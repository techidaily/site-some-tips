* Fast download speeds
* Tons of server locations
* Compatible with a huge number of platforms

Cons

### ExpressVPN

#### Best VPN for Chrome overall

ExpressVPN is one of the most widely used VPNs. It supports many platforms and has a hefty ensemble of protocols from which to choose. Its Chrome extension has garnered many positive reviews, with thousands of users issuing high scores, bringing its average to 4.5 out of 5 stars.

ExpressVPN has servers in more countries than any other provider on this list, except NordVPN, so you'll have plenty of options.

While overall performance may vary depending on your internet connection and which server you're connecting to, ExpressVPN is fast and reliable, and we've found it consistently provides decent speeds. When we've used the extension, we noted little change to speeds, and it was unobtrusive -- a factor you want considering all the pop-ups and notifications we already have to deal with. 

**Review:** [**ExpressVPN review**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/expressvpn-review/)

You will need an ExpressVPN subscription to use the accompanying extension, which starts at $6.67 per month on a two-year plan (three months free). Customers say that despite the higher price point, ExpressVPN is simple and easy to use.

**ExpressVPN features:** **Chrome extension:** Yes | **Chrome Web Store rating**: 4.5 | ****Simultaneous connections:** 8 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and [many more](https://www.expressvpn.com/support/troubleshooting/supported-devices/) | **Logging:** No browsing logs, some connection logs | **Countries:** 105 | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: seven days on Android and iOS

Pros 
* Straightforward apps
* Fast and reliable connections
* Vast server network

Cons 
* No unlimited connections

### NordVPN

#### Best Chrome VPN for server network

NordVPN is one of the most popular consumer VPNs. It has many capabilities beyond a basic VPN and is one of our picks for the best VPN with a Chrome extension. 

NordVPN also supports all the major platforms and operating systems, so you can use it to secure the vast majority of your devices outside of your Chrome browser. For extra security, you can route your connection through a second server, known as a double VPN. 

In our latest speed tests, NordVPN performed well and, together with ExpressVPN, offered the best speeds and stability. It's great for accessing streaming services, too. The VPN provider offers 111 locations to connect to, and you can connect up to 10 devices to the service simultaneously. 

Customers say they like NordVPN's speed and security, and note that the customer support is impressive. The Chrome extension is lightweight, and many users consider it reliable and a great addition for day-to-day browsing and tasks.

**Review:** [**NordVPN review**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nord-vpn-review-an-in-depth-look-at-a-popular-vpn/)

If you're unsure if NordVPN will work for you, you can always try it and get a full refund within 30 days if you're not satisfied. NordVPN offers an additional three months for free with its two-year plan, which begins at $3.59 per month. You can also opt for one-year and one-month plans, at $4.99 per month and $12.99 per month, respectively.

**NordVPN features:** **Chrome extension:** Yes | **Chrome Web Store rating**: 4.2 | ****Simultaneous connections:** 10 | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Android TV, Chrome, Firefox, Edge | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries:** 111 | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: seven days on Android

### Surfshark VPN

#### Best budget Chrome VPN

Surfshark is one of the most affordable VPNs on the market and offers consistently low pricing for lengthy contracts.

In terms of security, Surfshark is rock solid. In our testing, we found no DNS or IP leaks. Unfortunately, Surfshark's connection times and speeds can be slower than its competitors. 

The VPN comes standard with several features: the VPN itself, of course, along with a cookie and ad blocker, a masked email generator, split tunneling (Bypasser), a double VPN option (MultiHop), and other options. Premium plans offer more, such as malware and webcam protection.

Users say they find Surfshark's Chrome extension easy to install and operate, considering it an extension that "just works" and makes it easier to access services restricted by local IPs. 

**Review:** [**Surfshark VPN review**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/surfshark-vpn-review/)

Surfshark pricing begins at $2.19 per month on a two-year plan. You can sign up for a one-year contract at a starting price of $2.99 per month, or get a month of access for $15.45\. One and two-year contracts come with three months of free access added to the length of your contract. 

**Surfshark VPN features:** **Chrome extension:** Yes | **Chrome Web Store rating**: 3.6 | ****Simultaneous connections:** Unlimited | **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Linux | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries**: 100 | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: seven days on Android, iOS, and macOS

Pros 
* A trustworthy free option
* Privacy-focused
* Reasonable speeds

Cons 
* Heavy restrictions on the free plan

### Proton VPN

#### Best free Chrome VPN

When something is free, there's usually a catch -- and a VPN service is no exception. We don't typically recommend many free VPN options, as many VPN providers will collect or sell your data in return, and this practice undermines the entire point of VPN security. 

Fortunately, paid subscribers back Proton VPN's free plan, and the team behind it puts security and privacy first. The trade-off? There's very limited server options and support for only one device.

**Also:** [**The best free VPNs**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/)

Proton VPN's Chrome extension (and overall) reviews are mixed, although many complaints are about the free option's restrictions. You can take this how you will, but many users still say that this VPN is secure and fast enough that few notice any speed changes when enabled. 

If you want to try out a paid plan, Proton VPN offers a two-year contract for $4.49 per month or a one-year option for the equivalent of $4.99 per month. A month of access costs $9.99.

**Proton VPN features:** **Chrome extension:** Yes | **Chrome Web Store rating**: 2.2 | ****Simultaneous connections:** 1 (free) 10 (paid) | **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Linux | **Kill switch:** Yes | **Logging:** None, except billing data | **Countries**: five (free), 91 (paid) | **Money-back guarantee:** 30 days | **Trial**: Free plan

## Is a Chrome VPN necessary? Can't I just use Incognito mode instead?

Using Incognito mode can help boost your privacy -- but not in the same way a VPN or VPN extension will. Incognito mode reduces the collection of data during a browsing session. It helps protect your privacy by deleting logs and information after a session, which can be useful if you share a device with others. As Google's April 2024 court settlement [showed](https://apnews.com/article/private-incognito-browsing-explainer-google-chrome-f8b3dd9ae41c5d9da027454e5c0c92c6), however, Chrome's Incognito mode isn't particularly effective. 

A VPN, in comparison, encrypts your connection, disguises your online activities, and masks your IP address. Using a VPN or VPN extension and then launching a private browsing session can be complementary, but relying on just one or the other isn't as effective.

## Should I use a VPN extension or a VPN app for Chrome?

Using just a VPN extension is best when you just want to hide your IP address and mask your internet traffic during short browsing sessions. Remember that you will only have protection enabled for the browser with the extension enabled. So, if you have a Chrome VPN extension, only data passing through the Chrome browser will be encrypted.

In comparison, a standalone VPN app grants you far more protection, as it can provide blanket coverage across all browser sessions and online services. The trade-off is that VPN apps are more likely to slow down your overall internet speed.

## How do I set up my Chrome VPN?

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Go to your VPN provider's website or the official Google Chrome Web Store. Find your VPN and click the "Add to Chrome" button.

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

You will then get a notice explaining what the extension does and can do. If you are happy to proceed, click Add Extension. If not, click Cancel.

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Sign in with your VPN credentials, and that's it! Remember that you can click the extension's icon anytime to enable or disable it.

## How we test VPN extensions for Chrome

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Many VPN providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've reviewed VPNs for years, spoken with their management and users, and developed a generally favorable impression of our top picks.

ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, every community, every local ISP, and every nation has a different infrastructure. 

We analyzed the best VPNs for Chrome below using the following criteria that were most important in helping you make an informed decision:

* **Performance:** Our top VPN recommendations must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN if your connection continually drops or lags.
* **Reliable extensions**: As Chrome is our priority, we ensured that each recommendation has a Chrome extension available that users consider useful, stable, and non-invasive.
* **Simultaneous connections**: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, or smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections.
* **Security**: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.
* **Kill switch**: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.
* **Geo-blocks and streaming**: We know VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well considering these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming or torrenting.
* **Platforms**: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our VPN recommendations, naturally, have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive app extensions, desktop software, and mobile apps.
* **Countries and servers**: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.
* **Trial length and price**: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days.

### What is the best free VPN Chrome extension?

We recommend Proton VPN and Windscribe as reliable, free VPNs with [Chrome extensions](https://protonvpn.com/download-chrome-extension). While our [free VPN recommendations](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-vpn/) are few and far between, Proton VPN has been developed by a team that puts security and privacy first.

### Does Chrome have a built-in VPN?

No. While Chrome is one of the safest and most well-featured browsers, it does not have a built-in VPN, although it supports VPN use and VPN extensions. You'll need to install a VPN to have the most secure experience on your Chrome browser.

### Is a VPN for Chrome safe?

All the VPN services on this list are trusted and vetted by ZDNET. The services we recommend have been around for a long time and provide the safest and most secure connections for Chrome and other browsers, or as standalone apps for your mobile devices.

### Can I use a VPN on a Chromebook?

If you want to protect a Chromebook, the Chrome browser extension won't necessarily be enough on its own, especially if you switch between browsers. Most VPN vendors recommend you protect your Chromebook by installing the vendors' Android app. Android apps now run on most modern Chromebooks, but older Chromebooks won't always have that capability. Be sure to check each vendor's compatibility list. Once you install the Android app on your Chromebook, you should be generally protected.

We recommend trying out ExpressVPN or NordVPN if you're looking for a compatible service for your Chromebook.

### How can I stay protected if my older Chromebook doesn't support Android apps?

The answer to this is much like the answer to anyone asking how to stay protected on old gear: sometimes, you can't. If your computer can't keep you safe online, either don't go online or seriously consider an upgrade. 

Once support and updates stop for legacy devices, you also won't receive security fixes, and if your Chromebook is older and doesn't have compatible Android apps, your options are limited. At a minimum, you shouldn't use your Chromebook for any sensitive tasks, such as accessing a financial service or email account.

### Does a Chrome VPN change your location?

If you want it to, yes. You can connect to a VPN in your home country (and sometimes, city) and still use the service to improve your security and privacy. Alternatively, you can pick a server in a completely different location. For example, if you're trying to access a media source that is blocked in the EU due to GDPR, appearing from the US will remove this geo-linked block.

## Are there alternative VPNs for Chrome worth considering?

If our above recommendations don't feel like the right fit, don't worry -- they aren't the only worthwhile VPNs with Chrome extensions. You can also consider the options below, which we have highlighted as worthwhile alternatives.

[Best alternative for affordability Private Internet Access Private Internet Access is a solid VPN that offers good speeds and stability.
