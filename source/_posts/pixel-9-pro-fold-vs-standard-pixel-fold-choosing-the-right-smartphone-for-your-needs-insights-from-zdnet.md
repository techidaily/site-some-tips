## Pixel 9 Pro Fold Vs. Standard Pixel Fold: Choosing the Right Smartphone for Your Needs - Insights From ZDNet

![Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/51bfbd245acc021c9c7516358a54bf329bb90934/2024/08/10/f477b41a-cd5b-40d7-b692-ddd4178caebd/dsc01787.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Google has finally introduced a follow-up to last year's surprisingly solid [Pixel Fold](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Ffold?hl=en-US). The new [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15878900-1723532402000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) isn't a direct successor to the original Fold; instead, it's a foldable version of the [Pixel 9 Pro](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-9041660-15880173-1723532405000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), complete with an updated design and new AI capabilities.

If you're in the market for a new folding phone, chances are you'll give the Pixel 9 Pro Fold some serious consideration. After all, it checks a lot of boxes, not just for folding phones but flagship phones in general. That being said, the original Pixel Fold is still rock-solid, and you can pick it up at many of the same places as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

So the question is: which Google Fold should you buy? Let's discuss.

## You should buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if…  

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

### 1\. You want the biggest screens  

The biggest advantage the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has over the regular Pixel Fold is being larger in size. The cover display jumps from 5.8 inches to 6.3 inches, giving you a ton more room to do things on your phone without having to open it. When you do unfold the device, it reveals an 8-inch Super Actua Flex panel, as opposed to the 7.6-inch display on the original model.

**Also: [Google Pixel 9, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold: Specs, features, and everything else we know so far](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-9-leak-reveals-three-flagship-phones-plus-pixel-9-pro-photos/)**

Google took a bit of unofficial inspiration from [OnePlus](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOnePlus-Dual-SIM-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad%2Fdp%2FB0CHN7M531%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C0cf9eef7-8c42-4f21-806c-d27889828ffe%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for the design of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with its larger screens -- and that's a good thing. Everything feels more spacious compared to the previous Fold; making multitasking easier. If you like having extra screen real estate, the newer model is the way to go.

### 2\. You want the latest specs and the most software updates

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Since the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the newest model, you'll get the latest and greatest specs that Google could cram into a folding phone.

This includes the company's new Tensor G4 processor, which offers better performance than last year's G3 and enables a ton of new AI capabilities (more on that later). Paired with the chip is 16GB of RAM, 256 or 512GB of storage, and Google's Titan M2 security chip. You also get a big 4,650mAh battery that supports 45W fast charging.

**Also: [I'm a diehard Pixel user, but I'm considering a change for two reasons (and I'm not alone)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/im-a-diehard-pixel-user-but-im-considering-a-change-for-two-reasons-and-im-not-alone/)**

Last year's Pixel Fold isn't a slouch in comparison. But overall, you'll get much better performance out of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold because of the newer chip, extra RAM, and all the work Google has done under the hood to tune things up so everything flies. 

You'll also get more software updates on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The Pixel Fold is only slated to receive six years' worth of software updates, whereas the 9 Pro Fold will get at least seven years, future-proofing the phone until 2031\. 

### 3\. You find AI useful

The Pixel Fold has a few neat AI features like Magic Editor and Google Gemini support, but it doesn't hold a candle to all the stuff the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can do.

Thanks to the Tensor G4, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets Gemini Live, which allows you to have a real conversation with Gemini in an assistant-like way to ask questions and get information on certain topics. It can also understand what you're seeing on your screen and offer more information on it. 

There's also the new Pixel Screenshots app for organizing screenshots and using AI to extract information from them, Pixel Studio for generating images with AI and customizing them to your liking, Add Me for adding yourself to photos with your friends, call recording with proactive transcriptions, and more.

Over time, Google will be rolling out even more AI tricks thanks to the Tensor G4, which makes the Pixel 9 Pro Fold the phone to get if you're riding the AI wave.

## You should buy the Google Pixel Fold if…

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

### 1\. You want to save money

The [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15878900-1723532402000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and [Pixel Fold](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Ffold) share the same $1,799 starting price, but once the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is available at most retailers, the Pixel Fold's price is likely to dip substantially.

We've seen the price go as low as $1,299 during special savings events, which means you can expect the same thing to happen over time as retailers begin to phase out their inventory and make way for the new phone. 

**Also: [Latest Android 15 beta brings important security features to protect you and your data](https://www.zdnet.com/article/latest-android-15-beta-brings-important-security-features-to-protect-you-and-your-data/)**

The best part is you'll still be getting a solid smartphone if you jump on a deal; the Pixel 9 Pro Fold might be newer, but many people (including myself) have zero complaints about the Pixel Fold's performance or relevance in 2024.

### 2\. You prefer a shorter phone

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

For every person who prefers a larger phone, there's someone who would rather keep things compact. The Pixel Fold successfully merged the compact nature of clamshell foldables with the convenience of the larger displays of book-style foldable. 

The 5.8-inch outer screen is easy to use with one hand and offers just enough room to not feel cramped. Then, when you open it up, the 7.6-inch panel gives you more room to stretch out and get some work done, watch a movie, and more.

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a good deal bigger than the Pixel Fold, and it's by no means as easy to use in one hand. If you want a compact foldable, it's hard not to recommend the Pixel Fold.

### 3\. You're okay with a slightly worse ultra-wide camera

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

Surprisingly, Google didn't make a ton of changes to the camera system with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Instead, all it really did was swap out the 10.8MP ultra-wide for a new 10.5MP sensor with a wider field of view. On both phones, you still get a primary 48MP camera and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x zoom.

We obviously need to test the new phone to see whether the cameras are substantially better, but knowing Google's processing algorithms for photos and videos, it's likely you'll be getting very similar results from each of these devices, which means you don't need to choke up the big bucks just for better cameras.

**Also: [The Pixel phone camera was already the best, but these new features make it even better](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-pixel-phone-camera-was-already-the-best-but-these-new-features-make-it-even-better/)**

Both the regular Pixel Fold and Pixel 9 Pro Fold come with the same camera tricks, including using the cover screen as a viewfinder and propping the phone up 90 degrees for hands-free photos. Sure, some features like Add Me might be missing from the Pixel Fold, but with such similar camera hardware, you'll be getting a greater value if you shop the older model.
