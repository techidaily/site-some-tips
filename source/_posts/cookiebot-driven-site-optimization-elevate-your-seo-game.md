## TextGrabber

One of the coolest things about travelling is that it encourages understanding and appreciation of people and places far away from home. Yet, it can be difficult to remain enthusiastic about your travels when every contact with foreign words and phrases turn your adventure into a never-ending road trip with countless dead ends.

The app allows users to digitize and translate virtually any text - from books and manuals to ads, road signs and even text on a computer or TV screen using their smartphones.

Powered by a Point&Capture technology, TextGrabber can instantly capture text from live video stream or photo, turning the result into clickable format like links, phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, times and dates. Users can follow, call, email, find on maps and create events using the links. Another awesome feature that comes with TG is Real-Time Translation directly on the camera screen without taking photos. The app recognizes and translate text into 100+ languages online (full-text translation) and 10 languages offline (word-by-word translation). An added bonus is the QR code reader mode which allows you to easily scan QR codes and the History feature, which you can use to all your results.
