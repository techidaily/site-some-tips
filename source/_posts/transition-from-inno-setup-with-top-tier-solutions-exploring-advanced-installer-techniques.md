![Usability](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/svg/versus/inno-setup/iconGears.svg "Usability")

#### Usability

#### Inno Setup

**Requires** users to write scripts to create installation packages, which can be difficult for those who are not familiar with the scripting languages.

The user interface of Inno Setup is more complex as it requires **advanced technical skills** to navigate it effectively.

#### Advanced Installer

Advanced Installer's user-friendly and powerful interface simplifies even the most complex features, making it **easier to learn** than Inno Setup's scripting-based approach.

Whether you're new to creating installers or a seasoned professional, the **user-friendly interface** saves you time while delivering excellent results.

![Feature Set](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/svg/versus/inno-setup/iconFileAssociations.svg "Feature Set")

#### Feature Set

#### Inno Setup

Has a **limited feature set** and doesnâ€™t support the most recent technologies, such as MSIX and App-V, which can limit the installation package's capabilities.

Additionally, the **lack of a visual design feature** can be a disadvantage for users who want to brand and customize their installation packages.

Furthermore, Inno Setup lacks some of the built-in validation checks and templates provided by Advanced Installer.

#### Advanced Installer

Offers a **wider range** of functionality, including support for MSI, MSIX and App-V technologies as well as advanced features like digital signature support and custom actions.

Advanced Installer also comes with tons of **built-in features** such as a rich [Dialog Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), [Licensing](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), [Updater](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), [Localization](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), [Repackager](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), [IIS](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), [MSIX](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), and [so much more](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/)!

![Customization and Automation](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/svg/versus/inno-setup/iconCustomActions.svg "Customization and Automation")

#### Customization & Automation

#### Inno Setup

May be **difficult** to customize, limiting the installation package's flexibility.

#### Advanced Installer

Is **highly customizable**, allowing users to configure installation packages to meet their specific needs.

Advanced Installer offers **automation features** that enable users to create installation packages quickly and efficiently, saving time and effort.

![Compatibility and Integration Tools](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/svg/versus/inno-setup/iconTools.svg "Compatibility and Integration Tools")

#### Compatibility & Integration Tools

#### Inno Setup

**Does not offer built-in integration** options with other tools or platforms.

However, Inno Setup has a scripting engine that enables programmers to use their own scripts and command-line tools to automate the creation and distribution of installation packages.

Inno Setup may have compatibility issues with newer versions of Windows, which can make it **challenging** for users to create installation packages that work on all versions of Windows.

#### Advanced Installer

Offers several integration options to connect with other tools and platforms, including:

* **Microsoft Visual Studio** \- Advanced Installer integrates directly into the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE, providing developers with a seamless and streamlined process for creating installation packages.
* **Command-line interface (CLI)** \- Advanced Installer includes a command-line interface that allows developers to automate the build and deployment of installation packages.
* **Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)** \- Advanced Installer offers integration with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, Azure DevOps and PowerShell allowing developers to automate the build and deployment process of installation packages as part of their DevOps pipeline.

![Support and Community](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/svg/versus/inno-setup/iconUserAccount.svg "Support and Community")

#### Support & Community

#### Inno Setup

Has a **community-driven** support structure where users can ask questions and get help from other users.

However, there is no formal support structure or paid support options available.

#### Advanced Installer

Offers **comprehensive support** for its users through multiple channels, including email support, [forum](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), [extensive documentation](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/), online [training resources](https://tools.techidaily.com/advancedinstaller/products/) and a blog updated weekly with all kinds of scenarios encountered in the industry.

![Less Consistent Development](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/svg/versus/inno-setup/iconLessConsistent.svg "Less Consistent Development")

In comparison, InnoSetup's development roadmap is less formal and relies more on community contributions and third-party add-ons. While this can provide more flexibility and customization options for users, it can also result in a less consistent and cohesive development roadmap.
