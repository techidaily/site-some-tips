##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Gone are the days when we had to take the assistance of Photoshop or any other heavyweight editing tool to change the background of our photos. Now, by integrating Artificial Intelligent features, we can use any online photo background changer to instantly remove the existing background of our images (or replace it with a new one). From all the available options, I have listed some of the most perfect photo background changer tools that you can readily use.

* [Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers](#part2)

## Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?

Ideally, you can consider using an image background changer due to either of the following reasons:

* While clicking an image, there could be unwanted objects or too many people in the background.
* You might have to completely remove the background of an image and use it for any other purpose.
* Chances are that you might want to use your photo for a professional task, and its background could not be so appealing.
* There could be any other creative reason for you to remove the background of a photo and apply any other layer instead.

## Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers

If you are looking for a reliable online photo background changer tool, then you can consider exploring the following solutions:

#### 2\. Remove BG

Remove BG is a perfect photo background changer tool that is extremely easy to use. Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.

#### 3\. Adobe Spark

If you are looking for a hassle-free solution to change a photo’s background, then you can also try Adobe Spark. The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.

![photo background changer spark](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg)

#### 4\. Wondershare PixCut

Developed by Wondershare, PixCut is a free online background changer tool that you can use on any browser. To use it, you just have to go to its official website and simply upload any photo. Now, the online tool would automatically remove the background of your photo with its smart AI features. Later, PixCut will let you save the file in the PNG format that you can edit on any application on your system or mobile.

#### 5\. Slazzer Photo Background Remover

Slazzer has come up with a wide range of utility tools, including an online photo background changer. The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.

#### 6\. Fotor Photo Background Changer

Fotor offers a couple of online features related to photo editing and this one is another smart tool that you can use on its website. The image background changer is easy to use, can remove the background of any photo, and let you replace it with a new one. While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).

![online photo background changer fotor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg)

#### 7\. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover

Clip Magic also offers a smart and quick solution to change the background of an image online. Once the photo is loaded to the online application, it will let you get rid of the background easily (without any technical hassle). Apart from that, you can also use its smart editor to make all kinds of minor changes to your photos easily.

#### 8\. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover

As the name suggests, this is a freely available image editor that can also be used to change a photo’s background. Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.

#### 9\. Foco Clipping

The next perfect photo background changer that I would recommend is from Foco Clipping. One of the best things about this online tool is that it can remove the background of multiple images at the same time. You can upload your photos in a bulk, let it process them, and remove their background. The image background changer is known for its exceptional results for cropping human figures with precise body and hair scaling.

#### 10.PicsArt Image Background Changer

The online photo background changer by PicsArt is quite easy to use and offers a wide range of features. You can upload your photos one by one and can manually edit them on its interface. The application can automatically remove the background of your image and would let you save it as a PNG file on your system (to be used offline with any other application).

Lastly, if you are looking for a free online background changer tool, then you can head to the website of Cut Out Pro. You can upload a photo from your computer’s storage or simply paste its URL. The application can automatically detect human figures, pets, cars, trees, designs, and several other objects. After removing the background, you can apply any other color, effect, or design as a background on its native interface as well.
