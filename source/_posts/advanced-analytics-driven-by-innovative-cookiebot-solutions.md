## Service level agreement

1.The following definitions apply to this SLA:

1.1\. “Annual Downtime Period” means the total number of hours for the applicable Subscription year during which the Service is unavailable to You due to Downtime Events. Annual Downtime Period does not include any unavailability resulting from any exclusion as provided in this SLA.

1.2\. “Annual Uptime” means the total number of hours for the applicable Subscription year during which the Service has been fully functional including any scheduled Downtime Events, which is published in advance at and can be tracked through [https://status.abbyy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), beta or trial periods.

1.3\. “Downtime Event” or “Major Outage” means the time in which the Service is unavailable to You as measured and determined solely by ABBYY on its servers and which can be tracked through <https://status.abbyy.com>.

2\. The commitments in this SLA are provided only to paying client.

3\. ABBYY commits to not be less than 99,5% of the Annual Uptime percentage for the Service.

4\. The general availability of the Service has no direct effect on the processing speed of individual pages or documents. There is no guaranteed processing speed.

5\. If the Annual Uptime percentage is less than 99,5%, ABBYY will calculate the Annual Downtime Period based on Downtime Events duration and ABBYY will credit Your Application with:

(i) _in case of ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud, ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud API, ABBYY Vantage Cloud and ABBYY Vantage Cloud for ISV Distribution_  – corresponding number of pages based on the following calculation: CNP = \[{(PPY/365days/24hours)\*DT hours}\*1,5\], where CNP stands for corresponding number of pages, PPY is pages per year based on Your annual Subscription package, DT hours are the total hours of Service unavailability, and 1,5 is a multiplier (coefficient).

(ii) _in case of ABBYY Timeline- corresponding number of hours rounded up to days where 1 (one) day shall be credited when the Service was not available for more than 1 (one) hour and for less than 24 (twenty-four) hours._

7\. You must provide ABBYY with all reasonable details regarding the claim, including but not limited to network trace routes, the URL(s) affected and any attempts made by You to resolve the Downtime Event.

8\. ABBYY shall verify Your claim and if the claim is substantiated, then ABBYY shall issue the corresponding credit to You as calculated above.

9\. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ABBYY BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, OR THE FAILURE OF THE SERVICE TO MEET THE ANNUAL UPTIME PERCENTAGE COMMITMENT, OR CAUSED BY ERRORS, INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, REMOVAL OF FILES, CHANGE IN FUNCTIONALITY, DEFECTS AND THE LIKE, HOWSOEVER CAUSED.
