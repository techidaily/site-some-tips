When Amazon released the [Echo Show 8](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAll-New-Echo-Show-8%2Fdp%2FB0BLS3Y632%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1), I was able to test it for a few months. Coming from a [first-generation Echo Show 8](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEcho-Show-8%2Fdp%2FB07PF1Y28C%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1) makes the upgrades to the third-generation model all the more noticeable.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Echo Show 8 (2023) The third-generation Echo Show 8 is available for $150 and features a vibrant, upgraded screen, improved speed, and a faster processor. View at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAll-New-Echo-Show-8%2Fdp%2FB0BLS3Y632%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

In addition to its sleeker design with edge-to-edge glass, center-set built-in camera, and smaller speaker enclosure, the 2023 Echo Show 8 features spatial audio, a faster processor than previous generations, and an upgraded smart home experience.

Amazon's updates to its third-generation Echo Show are evident from the moment you unbox the device. The typical plastic packaging is nowhere to be seen, as the device is wrapped mostly in recyclable materials. Amazon says 99% of the device's packaging is made of wood-fiber materials from "responsibly managed forests or recycled sources."

Once unboxed, the Echo Show 8 stands out from previous generations for its different design, particularly the speaker on the back. Other Echo Show devices have a tapered speaker back that doubles as a stand to hold the smart display up to make it self-standing. The latest Echo Show 8's speaker also props up the display, but it has a new design that is, in my humble opinion, an interesting choice.

The spatial audio speaker on the back, let's admit, looks a bit like a butt sticking out of the smart display -- just a sliver of it is visible. This isn't necessarily a negative thing, it's just the unfortunate perception the device gave me.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

Amazon finally placed the device's camera in the middle of the display instead of on the right, as it had done with each previous Echo Show. 

**Also: [Amazon's Echo Show 5 made me a smart display believer (and my daughter, too)](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/amazons-echo-show-5-made-me-a-smart-display-believer-and-my-daughter-too/)**

The upgraded 13MP camera is meant for video calls, making the center placement all the more beneficial. You no longer appear as if you're looking off to one side when on a video call.

The camera placement from the right to the center could also better support Visual ID, making it possible for the Echo Show 8 to detect when you're approaching the device.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

Visual ID personalization is available on the [Echo Show 10](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fecho-show-10%2Fdp%2FB07VHZ41L8%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1), [Echo Show 15](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BFZVFG6N%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1), and [Echo Show 8 second generation](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB084DC4LW6%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1) and newer. This feature makes it easier for each person in your household to have a personalized experience with the smart display.

Each household member who wants to use Visual ID has to enroll separately on each device; as Amazon explains, this visual data is stored locally on the device. When an enrolled member approaches the Echo Show 8, the screen will display personalized content, such as sticky notes someone else left for that person, calendars, and their favorite news.

The Echo Show 8 (2023) switches from Standby Mode to a more interactive screen when a registered user is detected.

Then there's Adaptive Content, an all-new feature Amazon is debuting with this third-generation device. Adaptive Content makes it easier for you to view content on the screen from a distance by simplifying it when no one is near the device and switching to a detailed view when you approach the Echo Show.

If you have also enrolled in Visual ID, then the displayed content will be personalized to you.

The latest Echo Show 8 is also a [smart speaker](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-smart-speaker/) with spatial audio. The device packs a pair of two-inch neodymium speakers for a vibrant directional feel and a surprisingly rich sound experience despite the size of the speaker, especially compared to the first-generation model and the [2023 Echo Show 5](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09B2SBHQK%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

## ZDNET's buying advice

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

The newest Echo Show 8 makes a compelling case for a smart display for both Alexa fans and smart home enthusiasts. Still, the $150 MSRP, higher than previous generations, could be a deterrent (though frequent discounts easily remediate that).

**Also: [Everything you need to start building a smart home](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/everything-you-need-to-start-a-smart-home-setup/)**

This latest smart display is notably faster than previous models regarding the screen's touch response and how quickly Alexa responds to and processes requests.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

The Echo Show 8 can locally process common smart home requests, such as when you ask Alexa to turn on a smart light or plug, for 40% faster responses. The new [Echo Show 8](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BLS3Y632%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cccb335e2-283c-413f-8e1e-71e7c0c83827%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is also not just a smart display with Alexa built-in, but a smart home hub like the Echo and higher-end Echo Show 10.

With support for Zigbee, Thread, and [Matter](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/matter-1-2-adds-support-for-9-new-smart-home-device-types-and-thats-not-all/), the Echo Show 8 can be a central nexus to set up and control compatible smart home devices and a smart assistant.
