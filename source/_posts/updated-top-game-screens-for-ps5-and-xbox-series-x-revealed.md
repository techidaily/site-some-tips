 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have proved to be excellent 4K gaming consoles, but to maximize the experience, you'll also need a high-quality gaming TV. You can play games on almost any TV, but would you rather get an experience built around 4K 120Hz games with HDR colors?

A good gaming TV should deliver a clear 4K picture with best-in-class black levels and the brightest highlights, along with spectacular color. While you are at it, you need to make sure that your 4K gaming TV is equipped with HDMI 2.1 ports. This will enable you to carry all the data needed to play a game in 4K at 120Hz. In this article, we aim to look at the top 5 best tv ps5 and Xbox series X compatible options in 2024.

This results from an OLED panel that maintains amazing low input latency while delivering rich detail and unbeatable contrast without requiring special local dimming processing. Moreover, G-Sync or FreeSync Premium are supported as well as automatic low latency mode.

There may not be a huge difference between the LG C1 and the LG CX it replaces, but it has a new processor that can upscale 4K content and a new Game Optimizer that combines all the gaming features onto a single interface. In addition to virtualized 5.1.2-channel sound, Dolby Atmos support is included as well.

#### **2\. Samsung QN90A/QN95A**

With the introduction of the Neo QLED TVs, Samsung has improved its QLED panels further. Particularly, this 4K flagship TV's deep blacks, exquisite colors, and precise HDR management make it one of the best OLED TVs.

Using a Neo Quantum 4K processor powered by artificial intelligence, the image quality is excellent. The Smart Mode optimizes all sources, so no matter what you watch, you'll love this screen.

Samsung's One Connect Box connects to the TV via fiber optic cable.

As for smart TV connectivity, Samsung's Tizen platform offers an assortment of apps such as Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+, and Now, along with all the usual catch-up TV features.
