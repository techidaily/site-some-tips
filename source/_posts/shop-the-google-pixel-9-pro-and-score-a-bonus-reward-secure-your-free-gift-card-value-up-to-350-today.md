The [Made by Google event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-expect-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/) on Tuesday showcased the company's latest products, including four new smartphones in the Pixel 9 series: the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

These smartphones range in price from $799 to $1,799, but if you preorder a Pixel 9 series phone at Amazon or Best Buy, you'll get a free gift card. At both retailers, you'll receive a $100 Amazon or Best Buy gift card, respectively, with the purchase of a [Pixel 9](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced%2Fdp%2FB0D7HWJDQM%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C0da7c8f1-777e-42f0-adef-d2c825ce88f2%7Cdtp&dtb=1), a $200 gift card for the [Pixel 9 Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-9-pro-128gb-unlocked-obsidian%2F6587887.p%3FskuId%3D6587887&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1)/[Pixel 9 Pro XL](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-pixel-9-pro-xl-256gb-unlocked-hazel%2F6587909.p%3FskuId%3D6587909&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), and a $350 gift card for the [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGoogle-Pixel-Pro-Fold-Smartphone%2Fdp%2FB0D7V1J2Y1%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C0da7c8f1-777e-42f0-adef-d2c825ce88f2%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

The Pixel 9 is the smallest of the four phones, and features a 6.3-inch Actua (not Super Actua) display, 12GB of RAM, a 10.5MP front camera, and only two rear cameras (50MP wide and 48MP ultrawide). 

The Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are the same phone, but in different sizes. While the Pixel 9 Pro has a 6.3-inch Super Actua display, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a larger 6.8-inch Super Actua display. Both Pro models come with one year of [Google One AI Premium Plan](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-get-free-access-to-googles-new-ai-subscription-includes-access-to-gemini-advanced-and-the-rebranded-duet-ai-heres-how/), which includes Gemini Advanced and Gemini Live access and 2TB of cloud storage. 

**Also:** [**Every Google Pixel 9 model compared: Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-google-pixel-9-model-compared-pixel-9-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-xl-and-pixel-9-pro-fold/)

Finally, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a 6.3-inch Actua outer display and an 8-inch Super Actua inner display, 16GB of RAM, a 10MP front camera, and a similar camera configuration as last year's Pixel Fold (48MP wide, 10.5MP ultrawide, and 10.8MP telephoto.) 

You can preorder any of these smartphones starting today, and they will officially be released on Aug. 22\. The gift card will be applied automatically to your cart when you preorder at Amazon and Best Buy.
