Are you looking for a secure way to migrate your website to the cloud? [ScalaHosting](https://www.scalahosting.com/) is a scalable managed cloud hosting service for small and medium-sized businesses. Its featured live-server support allows you to transform a self-managed host into a fully managed virtual private server (VPS).

## Managed cloud services made simple

ScalaHosting developed [SPanel](https://scalahosting-1.wistia.com/medias/pywd36bkb5). This is the first hosting control panel of its kind, providing website owners and developers the opportunity to switch from a shared to a cloud hosting service. SPanel is an all-in-one cloud management solution, allowing website developers to manage all of your hosting services on the cloud.

Along with giving you easy access to your hosting services, it also benefits website developers and site owners because it doesn't lock you into features and design of what you find with traditional hosting providers. Also, SPanel is currently the only hosting control panel featuring live server support, according to the company. Considering that ScalaHosting is #1 [on TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.scalahosting.com) for web hosting services, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing support will be there to make the integration easy. 

### Comparing SPanel and cPanel

SPanel allows you to become the hosting provider of your own website instead of relying on another party to do so. SPanel also doesn't require web developers to purchase an annual license, unlike cPanel, which does charge yearly fees. And for services you pay for under SPanel, you can receive a pricelock which is another feature not offered by cPanel hosting services. 

## Affordable and scalable solutions

What makes ScaleHosting such an incredible value is it comes with an anytime unconditional money-back guarantee. With many services, you'll receive a refund if you cancel within a specific window. ScalaHosting is a rarity in that it offers one with such flexible terms. 

It's also a scalable service, allowing your company to pay for as much CPU/RAM as your project needs dictate. If you need less RAM in the future, you can allocate that with a single click and receive credit for any resources you don't use -- another rarity among cloud host providers. You can also use e-commerce tools like improved SEO rankings, blacklist monitoring, and improved email delivery to stay in communication with your customers. 

[VIEW MORE ScalaHosting - Managed VPS hosting ScalaHosting offers managed VPS hosting for as low as $29.95 per month.

You also receive peace of mind support and ease of use. The integration is effortless and guaranteed, and you won't have to worry about any downtime with any of your websites. It also offers 24/7 managed support with an average 15-minute turnaround time on tickets. So on top of all the features your business needs, you'll also gain top-of-the-line tech support. 

## Become a host affordably
