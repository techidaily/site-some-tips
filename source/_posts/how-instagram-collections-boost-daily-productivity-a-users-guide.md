### Key Takeaways

* "Collections" is one of the best Instagram features that allows you to save similar types of posts under one roof so you can easily access them in the future.
* To create an Instagram Collection, open your profile page on Instagram, tap the hamburger icon, and select "Saved."
* From planning my future trips to creating a hilarious meme Collection, I use the Instagram Collection feature for various purposes.

 I often find products on Instagram that I want to buy later. I could just save the posts that show them, but instead, I throw them in an Instagram "Collection." It's much easier to find them later on, and this is just one example among many other situations where I find Instagram Collections really useful.

##  How to Create an Instagram Collection

 Instagram Collections allow you to essentially save posts and Reels to private folders. Typically, Collections are made to save a particular type of post under one roof so that you can easily access them, but they can be used for whatever you want.

 It's pretty easy to [create an Instagram Collection](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-the-power-of-expression-emojis-in-your-discord-statues/). To do that, open the Instagram app, go to your profile, tap the three dots in the upper-right corner, and select "Saved." From here, select "All Posts" and then choose the posts you want to add to your Collection. Once you've selected them, tap the "Add to Collection" option.

 Give your Collection a name, and then hit the "Save" button.

Close 

 That's it! You've created a Collection on Instagram, and you can access it anytime under the "Saved" section.

##  Saving Up for My Travels

 I love traveling, and I hope you do too! In fact, whenever I head out on a trip, I aim to cover at least three destinations, making sure to visit all the must-see locations of those destinations. To make exploring multiple places on a single trip easier, [I use Instagram's Collections feature](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-best-mobile-recording-software-roundup/).

 I create private folders of posts related to the places I want to visit. For example, if I'm planning a trip to three states in India, I create three Collections, each containing posts about each state. This makes it super easy to check out the must-visit spots in each specific state.

##  Set Up a Collection of Inspirational Posts

 As a writer for How-To Geek, I'm constantly on the lookout for fresh ideas that readers like you will love. But let's be honest, it's not always easy. Sometimes, my brain just hits a wall when it comes to brainstorming. That's when it's easy to get discouraged.

 But thankfully, I've created a Collection of some of the best inspirational posts on Instagram that help me out during those times. I look at them and get motivated to start thinking again and looking for more ideas.

##  Keeping an Eye on the Competition

 My father has a clothing store, and recognizing the current trend of online shopping, he created an [Instagram Business account](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-detailed-instructions-maximizing-mobizen-record-functionality/) for the store. He uses his store's Instagram account not only to inform his audience about any ongoing sales at the shop but also to monitor what his competitors are doing.

 Specifically, he creates a Collection of Instagram posts that showcase the offers and strategies his competitors are implementing to boost their businesses. Then, once he has enough data, he analyzes those posts and develops a unique strategy that he believes will be beneficial for his shop.

##  Plan My Future Purchases

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 As I mentioned before, I use Instagram Collections to plan my future purchases. The problem is that both my girlfriend and I are online shopping addicts. We follow a bunch of shopping brands on Instagram that post gorgeous Collections that often catch our eye.

 However, we don't always have the money to buy everything we see. That's why we created a Collection of products we find on Instagram that we want to buy later.

 Whenever we have the money, we simply go to our "Future Purchases" Instagram Collection and check out the details of the product instead of hunting through our saved posts. Believe me, searching for posts with the product we wanted to buy would've taken forever if we had just saved them regularly since we both tend to save a lot of stuff on Instagram.

##  Organize Memories

 I have an iPhone, and its [Photos app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photos/id1584215428) lets me [organize photos into different albums](https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/why-blind-faith-in-ai-can-be-risky-top-6-concerns/), with each album containing photos of a specific type of event. But what about the hundreds of photos I've uploaded to my Instagram account or the ones I'm in that were uploaded by my friends? Believe me, Instagram Collections are a great way to organize photos on Instagram.

 For example, I have an Instagram Collection that contains photos from my best friend's wedding. That Collection includes photos from the wedding that I uploaded, as well as ones that were uploaded by my friends. Whenever I meet with my best friend, we often look at that Collection to reminisce about all those moments.

##  Collect My Favorite Memes

[Meme](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-boosting-your-gaming-footage-on-latest-windows-11/) is one of the most popular words these days, and what better place to find some of the funniest memes on the internet than Instagram? Honestly, I love watching memes and can easily spend hours laughing at them. In fact, I've created an Instagram Collection of some of the best memes I've found on the platform.

 Whenever I'm feeling down or need a good laugh, I check out that Collection. I've even created multiple meme Collections, with each one focusing on a specific type of meme, and at the end of every month, my friends and I share our meme Collections with each other to see who has the better one.

 This is all about how I use Instagram Collections to make my daily life easier. The possibilities of using this feature are endless, and you can find it useful in many situations. You could create a Collection of different dishes you find on Instagram or a Collection of shows that are exclusive to Instagram.
