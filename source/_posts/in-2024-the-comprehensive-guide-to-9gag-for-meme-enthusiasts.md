##### Step3 Add soundtracks and captions

The timeline should then include the video file. Select the text style you want to use by clicking the "Title" tab. Enter the text, then change the font, color, and size of the caption.

Your video meme will now be immediately posted to Vimeo or YouTube after you click the "Export" button. To share your finished meme with colleagues or friends, save it and post it immediately to your email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
