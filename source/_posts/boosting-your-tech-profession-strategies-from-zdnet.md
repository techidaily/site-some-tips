## Boosting Your Tech Profession: Strategies From ZDNet

The tech industry continues to grow, which means high demand for professionals with tech skills. But once you've broken into tech, how can you advance? Expanding your tech skills, jumping on growing fields, and targeting higher-paying roles all help tech professionals move up the ladder.

Whether you're still in school or recently launched a tech career, you need to start thinking about your next career move now. As tech evolves at a fast pace, professionals need to stay ahead of the curve. That means continuously investing in skills training and professional development. Actively networking, adding programming languages, and researching the industry can translate into better career prospects. 

This guide walks through the key steps to advance your technology career.

## Build marketable new skills and knowledge

Adding marketable skills to your resume helps professionals advance. Thanks to the rapid evolution of the tech industry, professionals must keep their knowledge and skills current. Fortunately, learners benefit from a variety of options to strengthen their tech skills. From accelerated bootcamps to master's programs, here are the best ways to expand your skills. 

### Try a tech bootcamp

A [coding bootcamp](https://academy.zdnet.com/) helps newcomers break into the field. Bootcamps also help current tech professionals add skills and transition into new roles. In the skills-based tech field, employers hire job candidates who demonstrate proficiency in their tech stack. A focused bootcamp can provide those job-ready skills.

Bootcamps focus on specific languages and technologies, including Python, Java, and the C-family languages. Specialized bootcamps also teach niche areas like Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Most bootcamps take between 12-24 weeks to complete.

### Find the right bootcamp for you

What's the right bootcamp to advance your technology career? The answer depends on your goals, experience, and timeline. Before enrolling in a bootcamp, consider factors like the cost, the time commitment, and the delivery format. Many bootcamps offer in-person and online options, for example. 

Prospective students should also examine the content focus of different bootcamps to make sure programs align with their career goals. Learners study many [popular programming languages](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-programming-language/) in bootcamps. Unlike degree-granting programs, most bootcamps do not hold accreditation. However, some colleges offer bootcamps and hold programmatic accreditation from organizations like [ABET](https://www.abet.org/), which accredits computer science and tech programs.

Finally, research whether bootcamps offer career services, including mock interviews and career coaching. 

### Pursue an advanced degree

A [master's degree](https://www.zdnet.com/article/job-skills-masters-degree-key-to-higher-pay-for-it-pros/) opens new doors for technology professionals. Many employers prefer to hire candidates with a graduate degree for management roles, Some career paths, including in data science, require a master's degree. Finally, professionals with a master's degree [earn higher salaries](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2021/data-on-display/education-pays.htm) than those with a bachelor's degree.

Earning a master's degree typically takes two years, though some programs offer an accelerated one-year route to a degree. Learners should always choose an accredited program.

**Why an online program might work for you:** Online programs prioritize flexibility. Distance learners enrolled in asynchronous courses arrange their assignments around other responsibilities, including their work schedule. And accelerated online programs help students reach their educational goals in less time. Many accredited universities offer online tech degrees, including MBA and computer science degrees.
