## Top Cloud Certification Programs of 2023: Expert Recommendations From Tech Industry Leaders

Up until about a decade ago, most enterprises simply didn't trust having their business and customer data in someone else's cloud data store. Security and easy accessibility were the pain points, but that old school of thought has dissipated with the fast development of safer, more reliable, more user-friendly cloud-based systems. 

This change, led largely by the fintech sector, has brought huge success to service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others. As a result of all this movement to the cloud, a great deal more software development is being done for applications that connect business data to processors and storage in public cloud systems. This is creating more jobs in this sector, so a whole new group of people needs to be instructed about how to facilitate safe and reliable cloud architectures and services. 

If you've chosen to pursue a career in cloud infrastructure and development, you have some excellent options for upskilling. Key questions to ask: Are you going to cast your lot for an[AWS certification](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/which-aws-certification-should-i-take) career path? Or perhaps you want to enlist for a [Microsoft Azure certification](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/which-azure-certification-is-right-for-me); maybe you want to master [multi-cloud](https://acloudguru.com/blog/business/6-big-multi-cloud-questions-how-ge-uses-aws-and-azure) development? Hard to go wrong with any of these choices. 

Here is a listing of the most respected and highest-valued cloud development certificates now available, ranked according to average salaries. 

[Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect Qualifies pros for highest-salaried cloud positions](https://acloudguru.com/course/google-certified-professional-cloud-architect) 

While Google Cloud (GCP) may be third in public cloud usage, this challenging certification has been number one across multiple lists of top-paying IT certifications since it became available in 2017\. Professionals who earn the certification of Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect average $169,029 per year, according to a survey conducted by [Global Knowledge](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/resources/resource-library/articles/top-paying-certifications/). This is the highest-ranked salary level for a [cloud architect](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/what-is-a-cloud-architect-and-how-do-you-become-one) certification and second-ranked on the overall IT salary list only to Google Certified Professional Data Engineers, who bring in $171,749\. 

[Google's Professional Cloud Architect](https://acloudguru.com/course/google-certified-professional-cloud-architect) (PCA) certification exam is difficult, according to industry insiders and test-takers. To answer the questions asked in the Google certification exam, you need to have solid experience in working with GCP. Compared with a similar AWS test, both challenge the skills of the candidates based on scenario-based questions, but GCP's exams also require candidates to have a developer background.

[AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate Difficult to earn but worth the hassle](https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02) 

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect -- Associate is one of the most difficult AWS certifications to earn. To obtain this certification, candidates need in-depth knowledge of cloud computing and many of the essential AWS services. Prior to gaining this certification, most successful candidates already had several years of AWS experience.

The AWS Solutions Architect – Associate is the most popular AWS certification, which means it's one of the most popular cloud certifications available. The most likely job role for people with this credential is cloud architect, and 75% of cloud architects have earned one of them; 28% have both, according to Global Knowledge.

[Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals Important fundamental training for Azure Web Services](https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals) 

Azure Fundamentals certification is an opportunity to prove knowledge of cloud concepts, Azure services, Azure workloads, security and privacy in Azure, as well as Azure pricing and support. So why is an intro-level certification landing a high position on the list, and why is it one of the[top-paying Azure certifications](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/what-are-the-top-paying-microsoft-azure-certifications)? It's likely because there are so many roles that can benefit from the fundamental understanding of cloud and Azure that comes with it. This means it's not just Azure engineers and architects but cloud-adjacent folks, from leadership to sales to support, who are also in the mix.

[Coursera's program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-az-900) and others cover the basics of Azure. Average salary: $127,000.

## How did we choose these certifications?

We put together the list after referencing a number of excellent resources, including home sites of AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Azure. Additionally, we referenced Pluralsight's ACloudGuru.com, Coursera, Cloud Academy, Udemy, Global Knowledge, Indeed.com, Statista, Simplilearn.com, and Payscale.com

## How do you determine a cloud career path that's best for you?

It's logical to select the certification with the promise of the highest average pay. But there are other things to consider; you should give careful thought about which cloud you're going to concentrate in. 

AWS is the market leader among public cloud platform providers, with 76% of global enterprises running apps or experimenting with them on Amazon's cloud, [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/511467/worldwide-survey-public-coud-services-running-application/). Microsoft is second with 63% market penetration, and Google is third with 35%. Generally, AWS and Azure cater more often to enterprises of various sizes and a number of smaller businesses, while Google is used more often by developers at tech companies, the military, and scientific organizations. 

A cloud platform's greater market share doesn't necessarily mean higher pay for the professionals who work with it. In fact, expertise on a smaller but growing platform can be lucrative. Google Cloud Platform, for example, doesn't have the market penetration of AWS or Azure, but its top certification yields the highest average salary for cloud professionals. That's not to say you should ignore market share; a platform's adoption and popularity can help you assess the health of the job market in your area. 

Online communities, such as LinkedIn groups, cloud-related sub-Reddits, various discussion forums, or the ACG [Discord server](https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/join-the-acg-community-on-discord), also can also provide valuable insights from a wider field of professionals.

Remember, it's not like you're limited to the first cloud certification you choose. Getting certified within and across cloud platforms isn't just a possibility, it may be a requirement at some point as you advance in your cloud computing career. According to Global Knowledge, about 64% of cloud professionals were cross-certified in 2020, and that number is expected to grow.
