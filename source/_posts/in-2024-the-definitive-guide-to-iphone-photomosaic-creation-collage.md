For general collage-making tips to help ease your way, we’ve included this first section for the best practices It’s short and it introduces fairly simple techniques, but it will save you some time in the future if you intend on creating a lot of collages.

### 01**Prepare Your Photographs**

In order to make it easier to **make a collage on iPhone** you’ll need to prep your photographs beforehand. Trust us on this A lot of apps don’t have a ‘Search’ function that you can use and scrolling through all your photos can be a pain (as it will not only result in mis-clicked photos but also, you might completely miss out on the images that you actually want to use for your **iPhone photo collage**.)

So, basically? Make sure to get them prepped beforehand And, if possible, keep them at the top of your images list or in an album so that they are easy to find.

### 02**Prepare an Aesthetic**

If you’re planning to print this collage out or just share it with your friends and family, then perhaps this step is not necessary. But, even then, if you want to impress, you might want to **make a collage on iPhone** with a set theme, you know? For example, choosing photographs that have the same effect on them or have repeating colors (i.e., pink-hued images with pink-hued images.) Doing this will make your resulting **iPhone photo collage** look much more cohesive in the end

### 03**Consider Placements Carefully**

Depending on what effect you’re looking for, the placing of all the photos in your **iPhone photo collage** is very important. Look at the sample image that we’ve attached Here, the letter ‘A’ stands out quite a lot and may make it harder to see the rest of the photos. But it also has the benefit of drawing the attention of the viewer again and again with how vibrant it is (and thus, it makes the rest of the photographs more likely to be seen than if it was just similar objects all placed together.)

### 07**Frames**

Frames, in the end, is quite similar to Collage Maker (making the two interchangeable).
