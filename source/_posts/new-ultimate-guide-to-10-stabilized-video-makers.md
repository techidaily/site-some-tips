The finest action cameras are great for filming anything intriguing, thrilling, or downright dangerous. Action cameras are available for a wide range of activities, including skiing, skydiving, mountain biking, and even vlogging your ordinary life.

Even though most of us have a smartphone with us, there are certain occasions when a camera constructed of more durable materials is necessary. Action cameras like the Hero from GoPro are well-known for their ability to be used in a wide variety of environments due to their portability and reliability.

For those looking for a high-quality **action cam image stabilization** that can go the additional mile, you're in luck. Here is a list of the top action cameras now on the market that we've tried and evaluated.

#### In this article

01 [Types of Stabilization in Action Cameras](#part1)

02 [Best Action Camera with Image Stabilization](#part2)

03 [How to Stabilize Action Camera Footage After Recording](#part3)

## Part 1: Types of Stabilization in Action Cameras

There exist three types of stabilization in action cameras. Learn about them below:

**1\. Gyroscope Image Stabilization**

When the action camera system is mechanically stabilized using information from a gyroscope, this is known as active gyro stabilization. Pan/tilt head counteracts gyroscope movements, decreasing tremor and vibration to maintain the picture. UAVs, vehicle-mounted systems, vessels and ships, and MAST and tower-mounted systems are most common.

The precision and speed of the gyroscope and the system latency both have a role in stabilizing performance. In contrast to compact, wide-angle cameras like GoPros, which only need consumer-grade electronics, long-range security cameras require military-grade gyroscopes and pan/tilt motors to offer enough stabilization.

**2\. Optical Image Stabilization**

This hardware technology employs a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope to appropriately detect movement and adapt the camera system. As an illustration, the OIS technology will adjust the camera to the right if your hand goes to the left when holding your phone.

**3\. Gimbal 3-Axis Image Stabilization**

If the person holding the camera moves up and down, left and right, in front and behind, a 3-axis gimbal will keep the camera steady in all directions. PTZ stabilization is the term used to describe this technique.

One definition of "gimbal" is a pivoted support that can rotate any item in one direction. In other words, a three-axis stabilizer makes it possible for anything placed on it to move independently of the person who is holding it. The item's movement is controlled by the gimbal, not by the person holding it.

## Part 2: Best Action Camera with Image Stabilization

With image stabilization, an action camera will capture the most apparent footage possible. If you're looking for a camera on a budget, here is the place to start. We've arranged the ranking list to appear first for the lowest and most economical cameras. Here, you may find the one for you.

### 1\. GoPro Hero10 Black

**Pricing:** $399.98

Greetings from the newest and greatest GoPro on the market. The Hero10 Black is a significant advance over the Hero9 Black, despite being released with little fanfare.

This is partly due to the usage of an entirely new GP2 processor, which provides a fast user interface and doubles frame rates, and is the most outstanding image stabilization technology to date.

GoPro's new HyperSmooth 4.0 video stabilization, together with the 23MP pictures and the best-ever low-light capabilities, are just as valuable as the 5.3K video at 60 frames per second.

### 2\. GoPro Hero8 Black

**Pricing**: $279.98

The smaller, lighter GoPro from 2019 may be suitable for you if you don't require 5K or a front-facing screen, even if it's almost two years old. Because of the fold-out feet, this model has an integrated camera mount of the fold-out feet, which makes it superior to its predecessors.

Then there's the Mods, a new line of wonderfully designed optional additions that can be added to the Hero8 Black; we particularly like the Display Mod, which adds a second monitor that's ideal for vlogging (something built-in to both the Hero9 Black and Hero10 Black).

The Hero8 Black's superb 4K footage and unique image stabilization mechanism seem to be a decent value alternative with a price decrease.

_Check the list of_ [_the best action cameras with front-facing screens_](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) _for vloggers._

### 3\. DJI Action 2

**Pricing:** $399

DJI's introduction of a front-screen on their first action camera caused GoPro to reconsider vloggers. Using a magnetic clip, the small 39x39mm square camera core of the Action 2 may be added to additional devices.

This provides greater connection, battery life, and a front-facing screen to give users more options. RockSteady 2.0 and HorizonSteady image stabilization are included with the camera, which features a 1 / 1.7" sensor.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. DJI Osmo Action

**Pricing**: $299

The Osmo Action was DJI's first action camera, but the company is better recognized for its drones (and, to a lesser extent, its handheld gimbal camera stabilizers).

GoPro Hero8 Black looks and feels like a direct rival, and it does a decent job of challenging the GoPro in that regard. The inclusion of a full-color front LCD makes it one of the finest action cameras for selfies or vlogging, and it is a cheap competitor to the GoPro Hero9 and Hero10.

### 5\. Sony RX0 II

**Pricing**: $698

Despite its high price, the Sony RX0 II has several features that make it worth considering. With a GoPro, you can't do that, but you can record brief bursts of slo-mo footage at up to 1,000 frames per second.

The RX0 Mark II, on the other hand, is capable of recording 4K UHD video directly to the camera's internal memory. In contrast, the RX0 was limited to external recording (and about time). Beautiful pictures are produced by the camera's 1-inch sensor, which increases low-light performance and delivers a stunning dynamic range.

It's a pricey investment, but if you want stunning slow-motion video and the highest possible picture quality, this is the most incredible action camera you can purchase right now.

### 6\. Insta360 ONE R Twin Edition

**Pricing**: $479.99

The Insta360 ONE R Twin Edition, released at the beginning of 2020, is a highly appealing product since it can be used as both an action camera and a 360 camera.

The "Twin Edition" refers to the fact that it's two cameras in one, each with two interchangeable lenses. When it comes to action cameras, there are two options: a straight 4K camera and one that allows you to shoot in 360 degrees (which can be extended with special housing).

In addition to the numerous filming modes, AI-powered algorithms also enhance the Auto Frame mode, automatically detecting and selecting the action in a 360-degree movie. This is incredibly amazing.

### 7\. AKASO EK7000 Pro 4K Action Camera

**Pricing**: $84.99

At the moment, numerous 4K video cameras are on the market, and to be honest, the 4K quality on most of them is rather good. Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) and a touch screen are included in the AKASO EK7000 Pro.

Only a handful of these entry-level cameras include a touchscreen, which is a feature I've only seen on a few. It's based on the GoPro Hero's standard design. Size and weight are identical to the GoPro, which measures 6 x 4 x 3 centimeters and weighs 115 grams.

### 8\. Brave 6 Plus

**Pricing**: $199.99

Brave 6 Plus is a no-frills, low-cost action camera that captures 4K video and has several other impressive features. The camera's design is based on previous action cameras, and it doesn't justify its low price.

There are several beautiful features, like picture stabilization, 4K streaming at 30fps and 1080p streaming at 90fps, the compatible Wi-Fi App for iOS and Android smartphones, a fully working touch screen, and voice control.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 9\. AKASO V50 Pro SE

**Pricing**: $139.99

The AKASO V50 Pro SE goes beyond its predecessors in design, build quality, and picture stabilization. The 6-axis gyroscope stabilizes movies using electronic picture stabilization. It can record at 4K 60fps and 1080p 120fps at the press of a button.

Like GoPro, AKASO's V50 Pro SE uses the same one-size-fits-all strategy. The SE's design is essentially similar to the V50 Pro's, but it captures the higher quality of the images. In contrast to many other cameras, the AKASO V50 Pro is a superbly designed technology.

### 10\. Akaso Brave 7 LE

**Pricing:** $139.99

Whether you're vlogging or filming yourself skiing down a hill with a selfie stick, this is an excellent investment. Although it has the same standout feature as the GoPro Hero 9 and the DJI Osmo Action, the second screen is far less expensive.

There includes a competent 6-axis picture stabilization system and 4K and 20 megapixels still photography. A second battery, mounting brackets, and underwater housing are all included in the package. Remember to utilize the housing before submerging your action camera in the water instead of many of its competitors.
