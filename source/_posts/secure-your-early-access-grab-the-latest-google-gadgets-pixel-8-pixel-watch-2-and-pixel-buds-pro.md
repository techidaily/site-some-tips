At Wednesday's [Made by Google event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/made-by-google-event-everything-we-expect-pixel-8-pro-watch-2/), the tech giant unveiled its latest device lineup: the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro phones, the Pixel Watch 2 smartwatch, and a refresh to last year's Pixel Buds Pro earbuds.

The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro feature an all-new design, with improved AI photo and video features that are powered by a Tensor G3 chipset, like Video Boost (which helps better record videos in low light), Audio Erase (which removes background noises from a video) and, for the Pro only, Best Take (which lets you swap out faces in a group photo with better ones). 

**Also:** [**Everything announced at the Made by Google event**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/made-by-google-event-everything-we-expect-pixel-8-pro-watch-2/)

Here's how to preorder the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Buds Pro -- and where you'll find the best prices and deals.
