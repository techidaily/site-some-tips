### Google Workspace

#### Best email hosting service overall

Formerly known as G-Suite, Google Workspace integrates an enterprise-level Gmail management interface with Google Docs, Meet, Calendar, and other tools. However, it's not just for the enterprise level -- far from it.

Features include custom and secure email, pooled storage ranging from 30GB to 5TB, and support. Enterprise clients can contact Google for tailored solutions. 

You can also test out the service for 14 days for free. Customers say Google Workspace is a reliable host, although some customer support issues should be ironed out.

| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Factors to consider when choosing an email hosting service

When you are on the hunt for a new email hosting provider, consider the factors below. 

* **Features**: Flexibility and different features are paramount when you select an email hosting service. Software bundles, sending tools, custom domains, billing options, and more could sway your choice, so you need to decide what features are the most important to you.
* **Affordability**: Most email hosting providers require customers to sign up for at least a year or more. You must consider the rolling fees over time and match your budget with the right host.
* **Reliability**: Ensure you pick an email hosting provider with minimal downtime. There's no point in paying for an unreliable host that could impact your access to the services you have signed up for.
* **Scalability**: If you own a small or midsize business, you may need to expand your operation. Consider choosing a provider that can quickly scale to match your evolving needs.
* **Security**: As email services are often the gateway to our other online services, choosing an email provider with a strong security record is worthwhile. Unfortunately, even the largest and best companies may eventually experience a breach, but you want to find a company that constantly works to improve its security posture.

## How did we choose these email hosting providers?

Many of us at ZDNET have decades of experience with email hosting providers. In making recommendations, we take this experience and combine it with crucial factors, including:

* **Familiarity**: We have included vendors that ZDNET authors are personally familiar with and feel comfortable recommending. After all, if we wouldn't use the service, it's probably not worth consideration.
* **Pricing**: We have included a range of email hosting providers that offer services and price points suitable for different clients. There's no point in paying for multiple inboxes or advanced features if you are unlikely to use them.
* **Security**: In today's world, filled with data breaches and cyberattacks, security must be at the forefront of your online communication channels. We selected providers known for their robust security practices and frequent upgrades, improvements, and audits.
* **Flexibility**: We like to see various email and hosting plans, including family and business options. We also consider offering contracts with different time frames important.
* **Customer support**: Signing up for a new email hosting service or switching providers can be stressful. We prefer to showcase companies that provide solid customer support over email, phone, and chat.

## Should I host my email?

While it is undoubtedly possible to self-host your email, and local backup options seem attractive, you will need some technological acumen and be willing to undergo the setup process, whether at home or by renting a server. For most users, signing up for an email hosting service is easier and quicker. 

## Do you get free email with a GoDaddy domain?

Domain purchases alone will not net you free email services. Instead, you will need to sign up for hosting, of which some plans will grant you free, professional email hosting for a year. 

## What is the best free email hosting service?

In most cases, you get what you pay for. Some robust and functional free email services are available, but keep in mind that they will likely have limitations. These could include the number of emails you can send daily, your email addresses, or the amount of storage available. 

Our best recommendation for a free email service is [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/pricing), which offers 1GB of storage, one user account, and one email address. 

## How do I properly recover a stolen email account with a Google server?

This doesn't just apply if you're using Google for your email. If you're using another hosting provider, but also using Gmail, you might need to get this answered. It's easiest if you can still log in. But even if you can't, Google offers a set of steps for you to follow. [Here's Google's page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6294825) to get you started. 

But keep in mind that the best way to avoid recovering a stolen email account is to protect it properly. Set up [multi-factor authentication](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839) and [get your recovery codes from Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538).

## What free email service ends in org?

There are free email services, but be careful: free services often come with other costs, including privacy. Since it's costly to maintain an email hosting service, those using free services may not get much support or may find the service disappears one day. Or, you may be bombarded with adverts every time you access your inbox.

Also, be careful of free services that are essentially phishing sites, capturing all the emails you get, including personal identifying information. That said, [mail.com](https://www.mail.com/) is a reasonably safe service that offers email addresses with the linuxmail.org and musician.org domains. Other free services, like Yahoo and Google, allow you to set up email aliases, so if you have another mailer that supports .org, you can get that email at your Yahoo or Gmail account.

## My web-hosted email stopped forwarding to my phone. How do I fix it?

There's not one single answer. It generally depends on your email provider and phone OS. If you use any standard email providers, you can go to [this troubleshooting page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211082) for iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and [this troubleshooter for the Google Android email app](https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/2650727?hl=en). Sometimes, you may need to update or reinstall your app.

## Are there alternative email hosting services worth considering?

There are a tremendous number of hosting providers on the market. As we said, just about every web hosting provider also offers email. But here are more providers that provide excellent email hosting services and support.
