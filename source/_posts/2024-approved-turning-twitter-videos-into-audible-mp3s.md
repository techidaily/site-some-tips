### Method 2: Convert Twitter Video to MP3 with an Effective Video-Editing Tool

## The Benefits of Saving Video Twitter to MP3

Converting a Twitter video to MP3 has immense benefits like offline playback, less mobile data usage, high-quality audio, and more. So, without wasting time, let's discuss some reasons to convert **Twitter video to MP3**.

**1\. Watch the video offline for free**

Are you always on the move with limited time to watch Twitter videos? Well, downloading a Twitter video to audio allows you to have an on-the-go music listening experience. As you may already know, you'll need an internet connection to play Twitter videos, a luxury you may not always have. So get a Twitter video converter and play the audio offline for free.

**2\. Gather sound effects**

You'll know the benefits of adding sound effects to videos if you're constantly editing videos on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and other social apps. Sound effects make videos more engaging by stimulating emotions, energy, and attention. And you know that finding free and quality sound effects can be challenging. For this reason, use a Twitter converter to extract sound effects from video.

**3\. Extract famous movie quotes**

Twitter is an excellent platform for sharing movies. Some of these movie characters are known for their unique style that can motivate and influence their fans. Of course, this also includes music lyrics. With a Twitter video converter, you can easily extract famous movie quotes and share them with friends online. Besides audio, you can convert the quotes to text using a speech-to-text converter.

**4\. Create an audiobook**

Many stories and cartoons are shared on Twitter that children will definitely find interesting. So, if you're a fan of audiobooks, convert these Twitter videos to MP3 and upload them online. For example, you can find a video where the narrator is reading a book or their own story. Take advantage of this!

**5\. Extract music from videos**

Listening to music on your smartphone or media player is more convenient than playing videos. The thing is that you can extract music from Twitter videos and create an offline mix. You can also use this music as your smartphone ringtone or share the music mix on social media and go viral.

**6\. Improved loading speed**

Videos are obviously bigger than audio. As such, loading Twitter into your media player or online platform will need more resources, making the process slow. Remember that most video bandwidths are two or three times larger than audio bandwidths. So, to reduce the bandwidth and increase the loading speed, convert the Twitter video to MP3 audio.

Now that you have all the reasons to convert Twitter to MP3, let's discuss the best Twitter MP3 downloader apps for online use. We'll also review the best professional-grade Twitter video converter for Mac/Windows PCs.

## Final Words

These are the best ways to download and convert Twitter to MP3\. With the online options, you can quickly download Twitter to high-quality MP3 or MP4 before using Wondershare Filmora to edit and convert the Twitter file. So, go ahead and play your Twitter video offline with these download programs. Thank us later!
