### Overview

COVID-19 forced us to change the ways we work, interact, and conduct business. Most importantly, supply chains had to adapt overnight to make it all work. Over the past year, supply chains upended their operations to remove people and touches from their processes without risking disruption to the delivery of vital goods and services to customers, who were more dependent on them than ever before. Contactless delivery, zero-touch fulfillment, clearances, and supply shortages all have become normalized in the past year, often with quick-fixes, workarounds, and many learning experiences.

This exclusive discussion explores proven techniques and best practices to transform your supply chain into the adaptable, streamlined system your company requires. 

### What you’ll learn:

* How to gain the visibility and control you need in your content-dependent processes using artificial intelligence adapted specifically to the needs of these processes
* How to gain control over exceptions, disruptions, and bottlenecks in your clearance processes
* How to streamline your operations and compete against emerging threat

Supply chains run on information, often in the form of unstructured content. Missing or inaccurate data from documents such as bills of lading, commercial invoices, dangerous goods declarations, and delivery receipts can delay or stop shipments; yet, these processes are often overlooked as areas for improvement.

Do you have true visibility into bottlenecks that are causing delays, and why? View this compelling discussion with Forrester's Analyst George Lawrie and ABBYY's Reggie Twigg, and gain key intel to help you take control.
