## Top 10 Sites for Vector Graphics Collection

Regular images like those in JPG or PNG formats are prevalent when discussing digital images. However, you will see pixelated imagery when you zoom in, making it look rougher and lousy. That is a significant issue when dealing with graphical artwork or logos- a clear and crisp look is essential.

This is where **vector images** come in handy, a type of graphical image format that utilizes points, curves, and lines instead of a group of pixels to form the image structure. That works better for digital logos and graphic art, although slightly complex to edit.

If you want to find free **vector stock images**, several websites offer a rich library of these options, including other functions like editing vector images. Here is a list of the best ones you should consider seriously.

![vector image example from vecteezy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-10-websites-for-premium-quality-vector-stock-images-in-2022-1.jpg)

There are specific formats for vector stock images that you should consider carefully to download the suitable graphical file for your project.

* **.ai (Adobe Illustrator)-** The AI file type mainly works for Adobe Illustrator users and is an option to replace old-school EPS files. Adobe apps can access and showcase these files in the best quality compared to other programs.
* **.eps (Encapsulated PostScript)-** The EPS or Encapsulated PostScript files are older vector image types for more extensive format-based printing. The text is easier to resize and enlarge in this lossless format with zero quality defects. It is commonly used in professional printing projects, like billboards and posters in the physical format and icons and logos in digital format. This is not compatible with other raster image formats.
* **PDF (Portable Document Format)-** The PDF file type relates to portable digital documents that are the standard option for forms, documents, and graphics. Note that this file extension type works with both raster and vector images- i.e., you can apply both images into a PDF file. In terms of usage, this format is best for getting high-quality uniform documental file prints.
* **.svg (Scalable Vector Graphics)-** SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics is the conventional vector file format that web designers focus on. It has universal open standard support, works on different browsers, and appears smooth and crisp during displays on differently-sized screens. The SVG files are mainly used for web-based file transfers.
