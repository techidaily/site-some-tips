## How to Configure Remote Desktop on Windows 11: A Step-by-Step Guide

With Remote Desktop Connection, you can connect to a computer running Windows from another computer running Windows that’s connected to the same network or to the Internet. For example, you can use all of your work computer’s programs, files, and network resources from your home computer, and it’s just like you’re sitting in front of your computer at work. 

  To connect to a remote computer, that computer must be turned on, it must have a network connection, Remote Desktop must be enabled, you must have network access to the remote computer (this could be through the Internet), and you must have permission to connect.   
  
 First let’s enable Remote Settings in order to connect successfully.  
  
 Enter**Allow remote access** **to your computer** on the search box and then open it.

 Right click the _**Start**_ button, select**Control Panel** .

 go to Windows Settings by clicking the _**Start**_ button and select the**_Settings_** icon as below.
