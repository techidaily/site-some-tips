 Backing up your files to the cloud is super convenient since you can access them anywhere and on any device. However, there is a chance that your cloud storage could become compromised. If that ever happens, you'll be glad not to have the things on this list stored in it.

##  Is It Safe to Store Your Files in The Cloud?

 How secure your cloud files are depends on your cloud storage service, but if you use [top-tier cloud services](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/navigating-the-truth-in-your-photos-an-instagram-selfie-audit/) like [Google Drive/One](https://one.google.com/) or [Icedrive](https://icedrive.net/), you can rest easy that your data is _mostly_ secure.

 I say mostly because, no matter how many security measures the [best cloud services](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/navigating-the-truth-in-your-photos-an-instagram-selfie-audit/) put in place, you’re still entrusting your files to a third party, and doing so creates vulnerabilities that a malicious actor can exploit to access your data.

 One such vulnerability is that cloud service providers are very attractive targets for hackers and scammers. Most of the time, there's nothing to worry about as these cloud storage services have robust security systems that protect against cyber threats. But sometimes, they fail, and this can result in data breaches. An example is [Dropbox, which suffered a breach](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-underwater-photographys-leading-seven-cams/) that exposed customer emails, phone numbers, and passwords.

 Another thing to consider is that not all cloud storage services have strict privacy policies. Some are more lax than others and do not eliminate the possibility of the company or its employees accessing the files you store.

 You could also inadvertently compromise your cloud account by using a weak password or falling victim to a phishing scam.

 So, while cloud storage is generally safe, its vulnerabilities make local storage a better option for some types of information. That's why I never back up these five things to the cloud.

##  Storing Explicit Media on the Cloud is a Recipe for Disaster

 Storing explicit images or videos on the cloud is a truly terrible idea. If your cloud storage is compromised, these images can be stolen, putting you at risk of a sextortion scam or even having these explicit images disseminated on the internet.

 This is exactly what played out in the infamous 2014 iCloud celebrity photo leak—an incident where cybercriminals accessed the iCloud accounts of several celebrities and obtained explicit photos. The pictures were then distributed on the internet, causing mental strain for the victims.

 A more recent reminder of the risk of storing explicit photos was the iOS [bug that caused pictures users had deleted](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-facebook-cover-video-all-you-need-to-know/) months or even years ago to reappear on iPhones and iPads. Apple clarified that the cause of the bug was a corrupt database entry stored locally on the device, and not an issue with iCloud. But it was an unsettling reminder that [deleted files are not truly gone](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-facebook-viewership-with-obs-broadcasts/) until they are overwritten.

 That means that explicit photos you upload to the cloud could still exist on a server somewhere, and could potentially be recovered long after they have been supposedly deleted. The chances of such a thing happening are slim, but with such high stakes, it's better to play it safe and keep all your NSFW pictures off the cloud.

##  Scanning and Uploading Your ID to the Cloud Might Not Be as Clever as You Think

 Scanning your IDs and uploading them to the cloud can seem like a convenient and clever solution to carrying around physical IDs, but it comes with significant risks. If your cloud storage account is compromised, malicious actors can gain access to your personal information, which they can use for identity theft, [phishing](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-essential-filmmakers-toolkit-a-guide-to-audio-recording/), and [social engineering](https://techidaily.com/how-to-factory-reset-oppo-a78-without-losing-data-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/) attacks.

 Moreover, these malicious actors might also obtain crucial information about you that could compromise other accounts. For example, they may learn answers to common security questions like “In what city were you born?” or “What high school did you attend?” With this information, they can easily reset your passwords and gain access to other sensitive accounts.

##  Your Financial Information Doesn’t Belong in the Cloud

 Storing sensitive financial documents like tax returns, credit card numbers, and bank account details in the cloud can expose you to financial fraud. If your account is ever breached, cybercriminals can use this information to take out loans in your name or access your accounts, leaving you with large financial losses and debt you didn't anticipate.

 Even if you don't lose any money or wind up saddled with any fraudulent debt, sorting out the mess is going to require time and effort. It is best to avoid the risk entirely.

##  Storing Your Passwords in the Cloud Can Trigger a Cascade of Password Failures

 These days, it feels like you need an account for everything, and it is nearly impossible to keep track of the different username and password combinations for all your accounts. Some people try to get around this by creating a text file to store their passwords and then saving it in the cloud for easy access.

 However, storing all your passwords in a single file on the cloud is like handing cybercriminals the keys to your entire digital life. If they breach one layer of defense, they gain access to every account you have, leading to a cascade of security failures.

 A much safer alternative is to use a [password manager](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-facebook-video-ads-with-free-video-creation-kit-for-2024/). With a password manager, you only need to remember one master password. The manager will securely handle the rest, generating strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, autofilling them when you log in, and alerting you if any of your passwords are compromised.

##  Keep Your Big Ideas Off the Cloud

 It's a good idea to store backups of your manuscripts and other intellectual property locally, rather than in the cloud. Otherwise, if your cloud storage is breached and your work is stolen, it can be nearly impossible to regain control.

 Instead of storing your sensitive files in the cloud, you'd be better off backing up your data to an external hard drive, [encrypting it](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultra-clear-gameplay-best-hdmi-21-monitors-for-ps5-gamers/), and storing it somewhere safe. It might make it more difficult for you to access your data, but when it comes to sensitive data, I believe the certainty of security far outweighs the convenience of accessibility.
