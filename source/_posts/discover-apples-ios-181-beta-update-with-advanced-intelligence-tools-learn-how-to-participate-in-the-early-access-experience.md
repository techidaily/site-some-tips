iPhone owners eager to check out [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/) can now download a public beta of iOS 18.1\. Packed with Apple's first round of AI-powered features, the new release was previously available only for developers but is now ready for the general public.

That's the good news. So what's the bad news?

Well, you'll need the right type of iPhone to try out Apple Intelligence. For now, that means either an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max. Starting tomorrow, though, anyone who snags one of the four [new iPhone 16 models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-16-pro-max-buying-advice-2024/) will also be able to install iOS 18.1 and take Apple's AI for a spin.

Though Apple plans to release Apple Intelligence in stages, you will find [an array of AI features in iOS 18.1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/). Writing tools will help you rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in Mail, Notes, and other supported apps. New photo tools will help you search for photos using natural language, while a [Clean Up Tool](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-beta-adds-photo-clean-up-ai-tool-and-notification-summaries-how-they-work/) will try to seamlessly remove unwanted elements from an image.

Using the Notes and Phone apps, you'll be able to [record, transcribe, and summarize a call](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-ios-18-will-let-you-record-phone-calls-without-a-third-party-app/) and other types of audio. Apple Intelligence will also provide AI-generated summaries of your notifications, emails, and other content so you can see the key details more quickly.

But many of us iPhone users are likely keeping fingers crossed for a [better Siri](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-will-improve-siri-in-2024-but-dont-expect-most-updates-until-2025/).

Infusing its voice assistant with a hefty dose of AI, Apple has promised that Siri will become more "natural, flexible, and deeply integrated" into the system. Activating Siri in iOS 18.1 displays a glowing light instead of the old-fashioned orb. You can switch between speaking and typing your questions and requests. Siri will try to understand what you're saying even if you fumble your words. Plus, the voice assistant will contain knowledge about Apple's products, so it should be able to answer questions about your device.

Even though iOS 18.1 is now in public beta and undoubtedly more stable than the developer flavor, you still want to be careful where you install it. Your best bet is to try it on a different iPhone than the one you rely on every day. Of course, that may be difficult given that only this year's and two of last year's models support Apple Intelligence. But you can still update an older phone to iOS 18.1; you just won't get Apple Intelligence.

To grab the new beta, head to Settings, select General, and tap Software Update. Select the option for Beta Updates and choose iOS 18 Public Beta. A screen will pop up prompting you to update to iOS 18.1 Beta. The same steps apply to an iPad where you can install iPadOS 18.1\. And as long as your iPad is powered by an M1 chip or higher, you'll be able to dive into Apple Intelligence.

If your iPhone or iPad supports Apple Intelligence and you want to try it, go to Settings, select Apple Intelligence & Siri, and then tap the button to join the Apple Intelligence waitlist.
