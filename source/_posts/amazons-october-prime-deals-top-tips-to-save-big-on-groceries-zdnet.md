Thanks to Amazon's October Prime Day, the Deals section in Amazon Fresh is stocked with coupons and sales. You can now save on your favorite foods, from yogurt and oat milk to soda and pantry staples. 

These coupons are applied when you check out, so you won't see the discount in your cart until you reach the final confirmation page.

Amazon

Aside from coupons, Amazon Fresh has a page reserved for product markdowns, and the deals are even better during October Prime Day. 

Product markdowns include overstocked and seasonal products but also manufacturer and retailer discounts. So you can browse through the different categories and score up to 51% off on anything from cleaner sprays to sparkling water. 

Unlike with coupons, markdown prices are as marked, so the final discounted price will be the one posted on the product page.
