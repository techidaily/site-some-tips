What makes images exciting and inviting? Borders and funny stickers can help to enhance your images effortlessly.

### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays

If you find your image still boring even after adding all the elements, borders, stickers, and drawings, you can apply high-quality effects and overlays to the images within no time. Effects act like filters that can change the color range of your picture, and each effect has a unique quality. The effects offered in this tool are atomic, creative, unicolor, vintage, and too old.

On the other hand, people like to use the feature of overlays to add extra layers and texture to their images for enhancement.
