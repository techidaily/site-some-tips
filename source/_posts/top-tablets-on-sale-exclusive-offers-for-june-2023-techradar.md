## What is the best tablet?

The[best tablet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tablet/) is the 10th-generation iPad based on its battery life of up to 10 hours, 256GB of storage, and lightweight design. It's the perfect tablet for working or streaming movies on the go. The fairly affordable price tag also makes it a great choice for students and remote workers who need a mobile work computer. 

However, the best tablet for you really depends on what you need your tablet for. If you're looking for something strictly for entertainment, Amazon Fire tablets and most Samsung tablets are great picks. If you want something to create on, you can bet on Wacom for professional drawing tablets.
