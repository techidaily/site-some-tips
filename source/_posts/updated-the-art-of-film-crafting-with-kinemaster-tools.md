## Part 2 How to Add Transitions in Kinemaster?

Transition reflects those animated effects such as swiping, screen zoom in/zoom out, and many visual effects that you can attach to your videos to bring about more weightage than a simple video. Or in other words, the transition can be added in between two video clips, that when played in continuation, gives it special effects whether in visuals or text animation, etc.

##### Step1 Launch Kinemaster

Using your Android or iOS device, you can easily download the software from the App Store. Then launch it; from the main interface, add your video clips/media files either from Media Browser or click the (+) symbol for the media files.

Note: to add transition effect, you need to add at least two clips or split the video in between to add a transition.

##### Step2 Open up the transition

Once video clips get uploaded, you will see the videos at the interface bottom area. Here, in between the clips, you will find the transition gap(menu). You need to click on it to view all the available transitions.

Note - If there is only one video uploaded, split the video to add the required transition.

![open transition menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/open-transition-menu.jpg)

There, you need to click on it. Doing so will open multiple transition options (Such as 3D effect, text transition, free-flowing, presentation, and a lot more).

##### Step3 Select the transition effect

Finally, please select the desired ones as per your video requirements and then apply them out of the available transitional effects. To check how that effect works, you can play and see it.
