## Top-Ranking Google Pixel Smartphones - Comprehensive Reviews by Tech Gurus at ZDNet

Google phones are known for their cameras, Pixel UI, and long-term software support. Many prefer them over other [Android phones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/), and even [iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/), for the exclusive software features. This year's [Pixel 9 lineup](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-every-google-pixel-9-phone-and-heres-my-initial-buying-advice/) is no different. Google has also shuffled around the lineup to include four flagship devices in the series, namely, the [Pixel 9](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-the-cheapest-pixel-9-is-my-sleeper-pick-for-best-google-phone-this-year/), Pixel 9 Pro, [Pixel 9 Pro XL](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-with-the-pixel-9-pro-xl-for-a-week-and-didnt-regret-it/), and [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-googles-1800-pixel-9-pro-fold-and-im-ready-to-leave-samsung/). The current crop also includes the [Pixel 8a](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-499-google-pixel-8a-looks-better-than-ever-with-many-of-the-new-ai-features/), and all of these devices stand tall in their own right.

The current Google Pixel lineup ranges in price from $500 with the Pixel 8a up to $1,800 with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The latest Pixel 9 series also includes a slew of new AI features and camera smarts with the help of Google Gemini.

### Google Pixel 9 Pro XL

#### Best Google Pixel phone overall

Google has three phones named Pixel 9 Pro this year, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL is the true successor to the Pixel 8 Pro. It features an upgraded display, which is sharper and brighter, a new chipset, and a lot more. The design is now iPhone-like with flat sides. These make it feel more premium to hold without being uncomfortable, thanks to the curved edges. You get an all-new camera module, too. I love how it looks.

The Google Pixel 9 Pro is powered by the Tensor G4 chipset. It's responsible for new AI features like Pixel Studio, better camera processing, and more. It still gets warm during demanding tasks, but I haven't faced stutters or lags on the new flagship. It is paired with 16GB of RAM -- the most on a Pixel phone to date with up to 1TB or storage.

As for the cameras, there are new AI features like Video Boost (which helps better record videos in low light), Add Me (to add yourself in group photos), and more. The front camera is better than ever as well. The phone's triple camera array, paired with the company's computational prowess, makes the Pixel 9 Pro XL the best device overall from Google. The company also says it's 2x more durable than the Pixel 8 Pro.

### Google Pixel 9 Pro

#### Best compact Google Pixel Pro phone

The Google Pixel 9 Pro is one-of-a-kind phone for those who want the best optics but in a smaller size. While the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max have camera differences in terms of telephoto lens, the Pixel 9 Pro's cameras are the same as the $100 more expensive Pixel 9 Pro.

When compared to the regular Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro features a sharper and brighter display, a telephoto sensor, a better and improved 42MP selfie shooter, 16GB of RAM, and more camera features like 8K video recording, Zoom Enhance, and more. These are plenty of reasons to warrant the extra $200 price tag over the Pixel 9.

You should buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro if you want all the best Google features and performance but in a 6.3-inch screen size and form factor. It will receive the same seven years worth of software, security and Pixel Drop upgrades.

**Google Pixel 9 Pro specs: Processor:** Google Tensor G4 | **Display:** 6.3 inches | **Storage options:** 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | **Rear cameras:** 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP telephoto, 42MP front | **Battery capacity:** 4,700 mAh | **Price:** Starting at $999

Pros 
* Siame primary and ultrawide cameras as the Pixel 9 Pro
* 7 years of software updates
* Feels more premium than before

Cons 
* No telephoto lens

### Google Pixel 9

#### Best Google Pixel phone for most people

The Pixel 9 Pro might be the phone to look out for, but since the Pixel 9 model is the same size, it means that you're getting a similar experience on a more affordable phone. WIth the base Pixel 9, you get the same screen size, battery, processor, and primary and ultrawide cameras as its Pro sibling.

The Pixel 9 is the best Google phone for most people because you get to experience most of the upgrades for less than $1,000\. The optics are as reliable as before, and you get even better camera tuning. The Pixel 9 also packs 12GB of RAM, which is the most for any base variant of a Google phone to date.

Several new AI features like Pixel Studio, Pixel Screenshots, Add Me, and more are part of the Pixel 9, too. In ways, the smaller Pixel is an even better phone than the larger Pro XL, such as ergonomics and feel in the hand. The ability to reach from one corner of the screen to the other without having to fidget around creates a better in-hand user experience.

Despite the $100 price hike, the Pixel 9 costs $200 less than the Pixel 9 Pro and $300 less than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This makes it one of the best phones in its price category.

Pros 
* Comfortable to hold design
* Good cameras
* AI features

Cons 
* Average battery life
* Thick bezels

### Google Pixel 8a

#### Best budget Google Pixel phone

The Google Pixel 8a is a toned-down version of the Pixel 8 but competes head-to-head with the flagship. The new Google budget phone features an updated design and borrows the Tensor G3 chipset from the Pixel 8 Pro. As a result, you get a slew of smart AI features throughout the user interface and camera. You are essentially getting a $1,000 phone experience for half the price.

The Pixel 8a features an upgraded 120Hz refresh rate display, which is sharp and contrasty but not as bright as I'd prefer in daylight. However, it's smooth and responsive in day-to-day usage. It carries over the Titan M2 chip and a built-in VPN for added security while using public Wi-Fi networks to protect your personal data from unauthorized access.

As for the cameras, they are the same as the Pixel 7a -- a 13MP selfie camera and a 64MP main rear camera alongside a 12MP ultrawide angle sensor. These offer great camera processing, skin tones and lovely lowlight results. It's great for hobbyist shutterbugs and professional photographers alike.

**Review: [Google Pixel 8A](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-compared-the-google-pixel-8a-with-every-major-sub-500-android-phone-heres-my-buying-advice/)**

**Google Pixel 8a specs: Processor:** Google Tensor G3 with Titan M2 | **Display:** 6.1 inches | **Storage options:** 128GB/256GB | **Rear cameras:** 64MP Quad PD Bayer, 13MP ultrawide, 13MP front | **Battery capacity**: Typical 4492mAh | **Price:** Starting at $499

Pros 
* Regular slab phone-like 20:9 external screen
* Foldable-focused software additions
* Good cameras

Cons 
* Battery life can be average
* Still comparatively heavy at 257 grams

### Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold

#### Best foldable Google Pixel phone

The most important design change for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is that it's now similar to the [OnePlus Open](https://www.zdnet.com/article/oneplus-first-ever-foldable-makes-samsung-and-googles-look-outdated-and-its-near-perfect/) and not the former [Pixel Fold](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-fold-review/). As a result, you get a 20:9 aspect ratio cover screen, which is the same as the Pixel 9 Pro, so you should be able to run apps without facing any scaling issues -- unlike the [Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-with-the-z-fold-6-for-two-weeks-and-cant-go-back/).

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a design overall on the inside too. You get better cameras but a smaller battery than before. However, it is now powered by a more efficient Tensor G4 processor, which should keep the battery life in check. You get to experience the same new AI features as the Pixel 9 series, including Add Me, Pixel Studio, and more.

There is a new feature called Made You Look that displays graphics on the cover screen where shooting with the phone unfolded. This is to make toddlers look towards the cameras. Like the other new Pixel phones, it'll get seven years of software, security, and Pixel Drop updates.

**Review:** [**Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-googles-1800-pixel-9-pro-fold-and-im-ready-to-leave-samsung/)

**Google Pixel Fold specs :** **Processor:** Google Tensor G4 | **Display:** 6.3 inches (outer) and 8.0 inches (inner) | **Storage:** 256GB, 512GB | **Rear cameras:** 48MP main, 10.5MP ultrawide, 10.8MP telephoto, and 10MP selfie shooter on both cover screen and inner display | **Battery capacity**: 4,650mAh | **Price**: $1,799

## What is the best Google phone?

The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL is our pick for best Google phone overall. Along with the ample photo and video editing features the phone contains, it's also sleek, premium-feeling, and has enough battery life for a long day of use. All told, it's one of the most dynamic phones on the market, with several AI features to back it up. See how the best Google Pixel phones compare based on price, processing speed, and display size below.

| **Google Pixel phone** | **Price** | **Processor**    | **Display size**      |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Pixel 9 Pro XL         | $1,099    | Google Tensor G4 | 6.8-inch              |
| Pixel 9 Pro            | $999      | Google Tensor G4 | 6.3-inch              |
| Pixel 9                | $799      | Google Tensor G4 | 6.3-inch              |
| Pixel 8a               | $499      | Google Tensor G4 | 6.1-inch              |
| Pixel 9 Pro Fold       | $1,799    | Google Tensor G4 | 6.3-inch and 8.0-inch |

## Which is the right Google Pixel phone for you?

If you're interested in a Google Pixel phone, it's nice that there aren't too many options available to confuse you or overwhelm your decision-making process. The first consideration is price. If you have a maximum amount you are willing to spend on a phone, then the price can dictate which is right for you.

Thankfully, when it comes to the software experience, Google provides about the same experience across all of the actively supported Pixel phones. You'll see some exclusive AI and camera features here and there, but the general experience is roughly the same.

| Google Pixel 8a                    | The best budget pick of the Google phones, with a starting price of $499, a 120Hz display, and wireless charging support.                                                                                                    |
| Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold            | Google's foldable overhaul that lets you switch between a compact 6.3-inch display and a productivity-enhancing 8.0-inch display. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold remains pricey, but it undercuts the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 by $100. |

## Factors to consider when choosing a Google Pixel phone

With several new Google Pixel phones being released each year, ZDNET spends at least two weeks with each model before deciding whether or not (and where) it sits within this buying guide. The qualifications I look for when curating the picks include the following: 

* **Availability:** The biggest factor is availability; is what's being selected available to purchase directly from Google, a local carrier, or an online retailer? Is it in stock? Or can it only be purchased in used or renewed condition? With the picks on this list, each one can be bought new and sealed, guaranteeing that you'll receive the most reliable experience from the start.
* **Value:** Just as important is the value that each Pixel phone brings. While all options on this list differ in price tiers, they each offer enough unique features, camera capabilities, and designs that make them worth paying for. If they're not worth it, they won't be on the list.
* **Performance:** Naturally, I only pick models that yield good to excellent performance, from the way they handle day-to-day tasks to more intensive use cases like gaming and video editing.

## How we test phones

Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:

* **Design and ergonomics:** How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.
* **Performance:** Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.
* **Camera quality:** ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.
* **Battery life and charging:** It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).
* **Special features:** These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.
* **Pricing and availability:** Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.

For an extensive rundown of our testing methodology, be sure to check out our [how we test phones article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-phones/). 

## Do all of these Pixel phones have water and dust resistance?

People use their smartphones everywhere today and having some level of dust and water resistance is important. You should not swim or intentionally submerge your phone for extended periods in water without a waterproof case. Warranties generally do not cover water damage. However, if you are outside in the rain, accidentally drop your phone in a puddle, or spill something on your phone, it should be able to survive such an incident.

On this list, the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold are the most protective of water and dust resistance, with an IP68 rating, followed by the Pixel 8a (IP67) and Pixel Fold (IPX8).

## Do all of these Pixel phones support wireless charging?

Wireless charging is a convenient way to charge your phone without having to plug in a USB-C cord directly into the phone. Wireless charging is also now rated as fast wireless charging in many cases, but even with this "fast" rating, it is still faster to charge up your phone with a direct USB-C cable.

**Also: [Is your Pixel battery draining faster than it should? This feature can help](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-your-pixel-phone-battery-draining-faster-than-it-should-this-feature-can-help/)** 

Every Pixel model on this list supports wireless charging.

## Are there alternative phones worth considering?

If you're open to alternatives, see below for ZDNET's best-tested picks, including ones from Google and other brands.
