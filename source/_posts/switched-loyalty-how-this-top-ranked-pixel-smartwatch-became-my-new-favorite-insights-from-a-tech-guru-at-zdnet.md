## Switched Loyalty: How This Top-Ranked Pixel Smartwatch Became My New Favorite - Insights From a Tech Guru at ZDNet

### ZDNET's key takeaways

* The 45mm [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3?hl=en-US) is available for $400 without LTE and $500 with LTE.
* The watch is beautifully designed and comfortable, the Fitbit integration is deep, the support for running is useful, and I appreciate the Google goodies.
* There is no protection around the glass display, you cannot customize the button actions, and there is no support for external sensors.

Google's Pixel Watch models are elegant, minimalist watches with extensive support for the Fitbit health and wellness ecosystem. Unfortunately, the first two generations were too small for me to wear daily, and after a month, I moved on to other wearables.

That won't be happening with the [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3?hl=en-US). In fact, the Pixel Watch 3 is actually pulling me to switch my daily driver to a Pixel 9 Pro, just to keep using the new watch.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Google Pixel Watch 3 The larger Pixel Watch 3 is a compelling smartwatch with a focus on running and connectivity. View at Store.google](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3?hl=en-US)

Google launched two sizes of the Pixel Watch 3, and for the past few weeks I have been using the larger 45mm model, which offers 40% more screen real estate than the Pixel Watch 2\. The larger display, also brighter with support for up to 2,000 nits, results in a much better fit on my larger wrist.

Plus, that larger display brings more data in one glance. My aging eyes also appreciate the ability to see the watch clearly by turning on larger fonts.

With a larger display and overall size, the battery is bigger, and I've regularly been able to go for nearly two days on a single charge. A few times, the battery level dropped to the 20% range right when I was ready to go for a run, but thankfully the Pixel Watch 3 charges up quickly, so I was able to get it back to 50% while I prepared and got dressed.

Speaking of running, Google optimized the Pixel Watch 3 to better support casual runners. It takes 14 days and nights of wearing the watch for Google to determine your cardio load goal. The watch will then show you recommended runs on the Coach tab in the Fitbit app on your phone.

The [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3?hl=en-US) does a great job of offering voice commands and clear graphics on the watch face to guide you through the different intervals in the workout. The workout is limited to two displays, one that can show four metrics and the other for your heart rate zone. This is fine for most runners, but those who like to track more metrics, race against a pace or previous runs, and see more than four metrics will find this experience limiting.

After your run, make sure to check out the new dashboard, which has an amazing amount of data in tables and charts, as well as insights and advice on how to improve. Metrics in the running performance screen show basics like heart rate, pace, distance, and elevation, as well as advanced metrics like ground contact time, vertical oscillation, cadence, and stride length. I love the details provided for your running form that help you understand what you should focus on to optimize your performance and reduce the likelihood of injuries.

Google's Pixel Watch models have proven to have accurate wrist-based heart rate sensors, and that continues with the Pixel Watch 3\. Unfortunately, just like the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, there is no support for connecting to external Bluetooth sensors.

Running tends to be when I often have new ideas and thoughts, so having the ability to capture these on the go is a major benefit. Google has a voice recorder app on the Pixel Watch 3, and it may be one of the best features I've discovered so far. I have it as my primary Tile.

The app lets you record a voice note, after which it will appear in the Recorder app on your Pixel smartphone, where you can take things even further. From there, you can transcribe the voice recordings, copy the transcriptions to Google Docs, and even share clips. You can also back up voice recordings to your Google account and access them at [recorder.google.com](https://recorder.google.com/).

Google has improved the Pixel Watch's Google product support with Nest camera streaming, which even includes the ability to activate the microphone and talk to people who appear on your cameras. The camera utility supports controlling all camera modes on front and back cameras on your connected Pixel smartphone. As incredible as those phone cameras are, this functionality makes the Pixel Watch an essential companion.

Another new feature that is not yet widely available is loss of pulse detection. It is wonderful to see Google rolling out health features that will save lives, and I hope to see this feature launched in the US soon. My dad passed away due to cardiac arrest, as someone only discovered him after about 15 minutes. With loss of pulse detection, someone could have been notified much sooner, and he may have survived.

As I mentioned in my [Pixel Watch 2 review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-2-review/) in October 2023, Google provides free cellular service for safety checks, emergency alerts/SOS, and fall detection alerts. In addition, if you buy the [LTE Pixel Watch 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3?hl=en-US), Google provides two years of free data for messaging, navigation, and music through its Google Fi service. Text messages work with your current phone number, too. Phone calls are not supported if you use this service, but you can pay to have your own wireless carrier enable an LTE connection.

The Pixel Watch 3's watch face options are outstanding: there are many complication options, and each face design can be customized exhaustively. While there are still a few gaps in the capability and availability of apps on the Pixel Watch compared to the Apple Watch, Google's additional apps make it a very compelling option. Google Assistant is fantastic, and having several cards in Google Wallet means I no longer need a Starbucks app or apps for other store loyalty cards.

## ZDNET's buying advice

When I saw the first Google Pixel Watch at a Made by Google event a couple of years ago, I was impressed with the minimalist form factor. Over the past couple of years, Google has significantly improved its smartwatch.

The [Pixel Watch 3](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5Fwatch%5F3?hl=en-US) meets all my needs, plus has additional features that exceed my expectations. If you own a Pixel smartphone, the Pixel Watch 3 is the best smartwatch you can get. If you are a casual runner, the watch is even an even more compelling wearable to consider, as it can serve as your coach and workout companion.
