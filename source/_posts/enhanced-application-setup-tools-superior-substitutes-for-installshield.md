### MSIX Support Level

In the packaging industry, MSIX is the newest, most expected delivery format for a software product. It is predicted to be the future of packaging and even prepared to replace the current, ubiquitous MSI.

Advanced Installer is the first authoring tool to support MSIX technology. Since 2018 - when Advanced Installer has been the launching partner for MSIX - we are constantly adding unique, useful, practical MSIX related functionalities.
