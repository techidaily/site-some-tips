## Revolutionizing On-the-Go Browsing: The New Feature of Personalized Shortcuts in Vivaldi Mobile Browser

Vivaldi is one of the best alternatives to Google Chrome, with endless customizstion on both desktop and mobile platforms. There's now an update rolling out for the Android, iPhone, and iPad with a few new features.

 Vivaldi has released its latest update for Android users. Vivaldi's new 6.8 version focuses on enhancing personalization and functionality, and it packs a few cool additions that you might want to check out (or might lure you into actually giving it a shot if you haven't). One notable addition is the customizable button in the address bar, replacing the Tracker & Ad Blocker button. You can now choose a button that performs a specific function of your choice, such as quick access to Bookmarks or a shortcut to New Tab, Share, Voice Search, or Translate.

 Bookmark management has also been improved with Nickname Matching, allowing you to easily find bookmarks by their assigned nicknames, simplifying the organization and access to your favorite websites. The Start Page has also received a customization upgrade, enabling you to modify Speed Dial displays, create new groups, or remove them entirely. Additionally, you can even personalize the background image to your liking.

 Vivaldi 6.8 addresses user feedback by refining the built-in Tracker and Ad Blocker, making it more effective in blocking unwanted content and trackers. Vivaldi already has a set of attractive features, and this new stuff might just convince you to give it a shot. The customizable button, in particular, might be useful as it will allow you to customize your browser to your liking.

 Vivaldi 6.8 should be rolling out to everyone on mobile now, although it could take a few days for it to reach everyone. The Vivaldi 6.8 update for desktop platforms [arrived at the end of June](https://win11.techidaily.com/addressing-win11-crashes-with-exception-handlers/), with an updated mail client and a few other changes.
