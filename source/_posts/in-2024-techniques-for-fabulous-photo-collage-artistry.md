Originally, mosaics refer to a unique style of placing broken tiles together to make a composition. But, in pictures, mosaics are digital images where the tiles are replaced by smaller images.

Making mosaic collages aren’t that hard once you have discovered the right **mosaic collage maker**. After that, it’s all a matter of selecting the right pictures.

#### In this article

01 [Types of Photo Mosaic Collage](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a Mosaic Collage?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Types of Photo Mosaic Collage

The art of mosaic has been around for a while and is now slowly making its digital transition into photomosaic art. There are various types of **photo mosaics** out there but not all of them can seem appealing to first-timers. Some of them are quite distinct while others are harder to recognize.

**●** **Individual Photos:** Usually, individual photos and portraits can look amazing as a photo mosaic. The chaotic effect it has on an image can be quite aesthetic. They are easier to create and gorgeous to look at.

**●** **Landscape Photos**: Landscapes are more complex. They involve a multitude of different colors it can get harder to match. Then again you can experiment with its multiple possibilities.

You can also categorize mosaic pictures according to how complicated it is to segregate the images within the collage. In these terms, there are two types of photomosaic collages;

### 01Single Color Composition

Each specific zone or portion of the target image is narrowed down to a few average colors. All images in your gallery are scanned to match a color that suits any single shortlisted color. These images are then placed in the place of the pixels whose color matches that of the pictures.

### 02Advanced Composition

A more advanced approach to photographic mosaics is when the matching is done pixel by pixel and the library images are then placed after much scrutiny. This takes more time than your usual average.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a Mosaic Collage?
