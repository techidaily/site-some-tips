## Strengthening Community Wellness with Targeted Ads

As you know, Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. It has over 2 billion active users every month and is used by businesses to promote their products or services online.

![med and health fb ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/med-and-health-fb-ads.jpg)

Facebook is very strict in advertising health and medical products or services because these products can be potentially harmful to users. Facebook wants to ensure that users are safe and that any health and medical products or services promoted on the platform are legitimate and effective.

If you are a health or medical business, it's important to be aware of Facebook's policies before promoting your products or services. Otherwise, your account may be restricted or even banned.

In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know about promoting health and medical products or services on Facebook. I'll also give you some tips on how to avoid getting your account restricted.

## Facebook Ads Policy for Medical and Health Products/Services

**Medical and Health Products:** Ads for medical and healthcare goods are generally permitted provided that they do not create negative self-perception or exaggerated claims, and that they comply with other relevant regulations (for example, Personal Health, Promotion of Prescription Drugs, and Unsafe Substances).

Prior written permission is required for advertisements that promote the sale of prescription drugs on Facebook. However, medical and healthcare goods, including prescription pharmaceuticals, may not be sold through our commerce platforms.

**Advertising Policy:** Facebook generally permits the promotion of medical and healthcare goods (except for unsafe supplements and prescription drugs), ad content must not contribute to negative self-perception in order to promote diet, weight reduction, or other health related items.

Additionally, advertisements must not make any deceptive, fraudulent, or incorrect claims. Facebook also bans advertising that include debunked healthcare product, therapy, and vaccination claims verified by third-party fact checkers or, in some cases, by organizations with particular expertise.

**Commerce Policy:** Facebook don't allow listings to promote the sale of any pharmaceuticals or medical services, such as prescription drugs and ingestible supplements.

## Getting Your Facebook Account Restricted

![facebook ads restricted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/facebook-ads-restricted.jpg)

If you violate any of Facebook's advertising policies, your account may be restricted. This means that you won't be able to run ads on Facebook or use your Facebook Page to promote your business.

There are a few things that can get your account restricted, such as:

* Advertising a restricted product or service
* Advertising false or misleading information
* Targeting your ads to minors
* Using personal multiple accounts to run ads for a business

If your account is restricted, you'll see a message from Facebook when you try to create an ad. The message will explain why your account is restricted and what you can do to get it reinstated.

To get your account reinstated, you'll need to submit an appeal to Facebook. You can do this by following the instructions in the message from Facebook. If your appeal is successful, your account will be reinstated and you'll be able to run ads on Facebook again.

## Tips for Avoiding Getting Your Facebook Account Restricted

![get facebook ads right](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/get-facebook-ads-right.jpg)

Here are some tips that will help you avoid getting your Facebook account restricted:

1. **Know the policies:** Familiarize yourself with Facebook's advertising policies so that you know what is and isn't allowed. This will help you avoid accidentally violate any of the policies.
2. **Target your audience:** Make sure that your ads are only being shown to people who are likely to be interested in them. Don't try to target minors with your ads.
3. **Use one account:** Only use one Facebook account to run ads for your business. Avoid using multiple accounts.
4. **Make Sure You're Not Being Misled or Exaggerated:** Don't make any false or misleading claims in your ads. This will violate Facebook's policies and could get your account restricted.

Examples to avoid are the following:

* In 10 days, you can earn money.
* Make More Money
* In 10 days, you can be healthy.
* This will cure your diabetes

1. **Be aware of restricted images on Facebook**

Be aware that Facebook has restrictions on the use of certain images in ads. If you use any of these restricted images in your ads, your account could be restricted.

* Before and after pictures
* X-rays
* Blood tests
* Cell phone pictures of skin conditions or open wounds
* People in hospital beds
* Children under the age of 18 without parental permission
* Photos that are graphic, gory, or violent
* Pictures of people in distress
* Images of internal organs or body parts
* Pictures of people taking medication
* Photos that have been Photoshopped

By following these tips, you can avoid getting your Facebook account restricted.

## How to Reduce the Number of Disapproved Ads

* Review Facebook's advertising policies and make sure that your ads comply with them.
* Checking your ad account regularly to see if any of your ads have been disapproved. If they have, edit the ad so that it complies with Facebook's policies and resubmit it for approval.
* Make sure that your ad images comply with Facebook's image guidelines.
* Keeping your ad text clear and concise.
* Creating a separate ad account for each of your businesses. This will help you keep track of which ads are associated with which business and make it easier to edit or delete ads that are no longer relevant.
* Be open and transparent to Facebook ads.
* Make sure you know what you're advertising.
* Avoid harmful offers or materials.
* Avoid using terms that are delicate or overly personal.
* Avoid using Affiliate Sites to sell things like making money or health remedies.
* As a general guideline, avoid using words like "other", "you", and "yours" in your copy as they can trigger disapproval.

If you follow these tips, you'll be less likely to have your ads disapproved by Facebook.

## Conclusion

There are many things to remember when running health and wellness business on Facebook. It can be hard to keep up with all the changes in policies and guidelines if you're not constantly paying attention, but it's important that you do so if you want your page available for as long as possible! If you're serious about growing a business on this platform then make sure to follow all rules set out by Facebook so that your account will remain active even when others try removing it because they disagree with what we offer here at The Wellness Centre: A place where people can find support through their own struggles through words written by others who understand what they're going through.
