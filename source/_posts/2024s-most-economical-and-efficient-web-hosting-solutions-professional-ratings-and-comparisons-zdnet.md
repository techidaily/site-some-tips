Pros 
* Affordable
* Beginner-friendly

Cons

### Hostinger

#### Best cheap web hosting overall

Hostinger has some of the absolute lowest introductory prices we've seen, with limited-time offers starting at $2.99 per month, with three months free. Considering the versatility of the plans and features on offer, Hostinger is one of our top choices for cheap, reliable web hosting. 

The starter and next-level plans support up to 100 websites. Hostinger provides users with up to 200GB of storage, 100 email addresses and forwarders, free SSL website security, unlimited bandwidth, and a free domain name. 

You'll be given one-click WordPress installation and free website migration, making this an excellent option for most website developers. However, if you want e-commerce capabilities, you'll need to opt for either a medium or higher tier. 

Hostinger also provides a drag-and-drop website builder and templates if you need a theme. You can also take advantage of features including Google Analytics integration, SEO tools, AI, SSH, DDoS protection, staging functionality for test purposes, and dedicated IP addresses (on premium plans). 

Overall, we consider Hostinger's cheaper plans to be an excellent option for smaller projects and businesses with an attractive price point. 

While many customers applaud Hostinger's customer service, some clients operating multiple websites have reported bounceback and slow loads.

**Hostinger features**: Multi-tier plans | Daily, weekly backups | Free SSL | Up to 200GB storage | Free email | Dedicated IP addresses | E-commerce support | Automatic patching, security updates

Pros 
* Cheap, no-contract monthly plans
* Good value three year plans

Cons 
* Email must be purchased separately

### DreamHost

#### Best cheap web hosting for novice website builders

Dreamhost offers the lowest prices with three-year commitments on shared starter plans, so if you want to know exactly how much your website will cost you monthly in the long term, consider the $2.59/month offer.

Shared plans come in two options: Starter (one website, email is an extra charge) and Unlimited (as many websites and email accounts as you wish for $3.95/month). Free domains are included for the first year which helps keep the cost down.

This option is great for first-time website owners, especially if you intend to use the WordPress content management system -- as a site builder, and over 200 templates are included as standard. Free SSL certificates are also included for a security boost. While we recommend considering the long-term plan, if you want a month-by-month option, it's only $4.95.

Customers say that support is top-notch, they appreciate the flexibility of the service, and many find WordPress-related services easy to use without technical knowledge. However, some find reaching customer support initially challenging.

**Dreamhost features:** 24/7 support | Automated daily backups | One-click WordPress installation | Free domain | Free SSL | 97-Day Money-back guarantee | 24/7 support

## Factors to consider when choosing a cheap web hosting provider

Below, you will find the important factors you should consider when you are looking for the best cheap web hosting provider available and on the market today.

* **Affordability**: One of the first questions you should ask is: what is your preferred budget? Keep in mind that promotional deals won't last forever and there may be price hikes after the first year.
* **Speed and stability**: Generally speaking, shared hosting is cheaper than dedicated hosting. However, if you anticipate high volumes of traffic or you want lightning-fast page loads, you may opt for slightly more expensive hosting packages.
* **E-commerce**: Consider whether or not your website will need e-commerce functionality. If this is on the horizon, it is likely the cost of your plan will change. However, you can get around this by selling from websites including eBay and Etsy.
* **Additional features**: Many web hosts are not shy about generating extra revenues through features like backup and site migration, so you'll have to factor in those costs before you can make an informed choice. If you choose a cheap plan, expect regular upsell offers for more full-featured (and significantly more expensive) plans.

## How did we choose these cheap web hosting services?

When choosing a web hosting package, there's more to consider than just a low price. We considered a wide range of extra factors that can be crucial when it comes time to separate contenders on your shortlist of hosting providers.

Let's start with the most important factor of all: A money-back guarantee. Every provider we surveyed offers at least 30 days during which you can try the service risk-free. Other factors include:

* **Customer support:** How many contact options does the provider offer for the plan you've chosen? If phone support isn't available and email and ticket-based systems are the primary mechanism for problem resolution, how quickly does the support team respond?
* **Bandwidth and storage:** For shared hosting plans, most providers offer "unlimited" data transfers and storage, but there's invariably a page full of fine print that requires you to abide by "reasonable" restrictions and acceptable-use policies.
* **Backup:** Automated online backups are the most reliable way to backup your website. Most hosting providers offer automatic backups, but some charge extra. We included options for, at least, daily and weekly backups.
* **Performance:** As a rule, the less you pay for a shared hosting plan, the more likely you are to encounter slow page loads, because those low-cost plans typically cluster more shared accounts on the server. We have included shared hosting with budgets in mind, but we also listed vendors that offer dedicated setups.
* **Security:** We ensured that our recommended vendors follow, at least, basic security best practices. Does the provider offer multi-factor authentication? Are crucial software packages updated automatically, or are you required to stay on top of updates yourself? It's important to consider such questions before you sign up.
* **Email and domain options:** Several providers offer free domain registration as part of a hosting package, but of course, the cost of that registration is built into the bill for the plan itself. Others may require domains and email services to be paid for separately, and we have considered each offering during our research.

## Are there free website hosting services?

Yes. But they often don't allow for many customization options. Free web hosting services include Wix, WordPress, and GoDaddy. They may also include advertisements. 

## How much does it cost to run a website?

It all depends on which web hosting platform you decide to use. But paid web hosting for a single website ranges anywhere from $2 to $10 per month. If you need enterprise-grade hosting, the cost can reach hundreds of dollars per month.

## Can cheap web hosts run WordPress?

WordPress hosting is a subset of standard website hosting and so the majority of providers will allow WordPress content management system (CMS) installs. Indeed, even the cheapest hosts will often provide one-click WordPress installation functions. 

## What do I need to run a small business website?

Typically, there are three services you will need, at minimum, for your website: a domain name, host, and email services. Many web hosts will give you a domain name for free -- at least, for your first year -- and they may also bundle in limited email services. However, keep in mind you might need to purchase these separately. If you intend to sell products on your website, you will need to select a package that supports e-commerce.

## Are there alternative web hosting platforms to consider?

You need to weigh your options before choosing a web hosting service. While these services didn't make their way into our main list, they are highly reliable and great options if none of the other web hosts appeal to you.
