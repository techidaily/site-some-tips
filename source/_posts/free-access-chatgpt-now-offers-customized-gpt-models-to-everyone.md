## Free Access: ChatGPT Now Offers Customized GPT Models to Everyone

OpenAI has started opening up more features to free users over the past few weeks. GPT-4o is available to both free and paid users, contrary to GPT-4, which was only available to Premium users while free users stuck with GPT-3.5\. Now, ChatGPT is making some formerly premium features available to free users as well, most notably with access to the pre-trained custom GPTs.

 OpenAI has significantly upgraded its free ChatGPT service, granting access to a suite of features previously exclusive to paid subscribers. These include [custom GPTs](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-inside-the-videography-realm-xstudio-study/), data analytics, chart creation, and the ability to ask questions about photos.

 The fact that we are getting custom GPTs in the paid tier might be helpful for a lot of people. GPTs are pre-trained custom instances of ChatGPT that are good for a variety of purposes, ranging from an on-demand thesaurus, an assistant to help you write papers, or even an Ikea shopping guide. Your mileage may vary in how much usefulness you can get out of them, but they're certainly worth a shot. There are a few restrictions compared to what you might get from the paid version, however. For one, unlike paid subscribers, free users cannot create their own custom GPTs. This means that you're only limited to what's available from the GPT Store, and you can't put one together for your ultra-niche use case unless you're willing to pay money.

 Another notable addition here is the data analytics and chart creation feature, which enables you to connect your OneDrive and Google Drive data to ChatGPT for analysis and personalized charts. You're also getting the ability to upload photos and files and ask questions about them. You could say that with these changes, there are less reasons to pay, but there's a few scenarios where you might still want to shell out those $20 a month. For one, paid subscribers retain an advantage in terms of message limits—free users who exceed the limit for [GPT-4o](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unlock-your-creative-potential-with-the-premier-free-software-lineup-on-mac-for-2024/) interactions will automatically switch to the less powerful GPT-3.5\. If you happen to use GPT-4o a lot, you might need to pay.
