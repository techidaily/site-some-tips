## Your Comprehensive Guide to All the Top Highlights From Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference 2024

Apple held its Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this week, revealing dozens of new features and changes coming to the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and other Apple devices. Here’s everything you might have missed.

 We got our first real look at the upcoming iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, iPadOS 18, visionOS 2, tvOS 18, and watchOS 11 updates this week. The big reveal was Apple Intelligence, the company’s long-awaited answer to the generative AI rush. Even though it looks more useful and more private than many other recent attempts at AI tools ([looking at you, Recall](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-of-yt-a-deep-dive-into-music-dance-clips-23/)), it won’t even enter testing until later this year, so there are still some open questions.
