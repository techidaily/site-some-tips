## Top-Rated Amazon Tablet Devices - Insights and Reviews by ZDNet

The market is full of quality tablet options, but due to its solid [Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/)operating system, Amazon and its manufacturer, Quanta Computer, produces one of the most capable tablets: Amazon Fire.

All Fire tablets run on Amazon's Android-based operating system, [Fire OS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/fire-os-better-than-android-for-the-masses/), and even though its an Android suite, it doesn't house any of Google's apps or services as Amazon has its own store developers use. That said, you can find most of the bigger apps, like [Microsoft's Office 365 suite](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-microsoft-365-formerly-office-365-everything-you-need-to-know/), Facebook, Zoom, and your favorite mobile games. However, Gmail, YouTube, or Google Maps aren't available. 

Until recently, Amazon's Fire tablet lineup has all had a consistent look and feel to it, with the main difference being size and internal specs. But with the release of the [Fire Max 1](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FIntroducing-Amazon-powerful-octa-core-processor%2Fdp%2FB0B1VQ1ZQY%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ccb0046b1-3b86-493d-a6e9-273890443e48%7Cdtp&dtb=1)1, Amazon is upping its tablet game, which easily makes it our pick for best Amazon tablet overall.

### Amazon Fire Max 11

#### Best Amazon tablet overall

**Tech specs: Display**: 11-inch, 2000 x 1200, 410 nits brightness, 213 ppi | **Processor**: MediaTek MT8188J, 2.2Ghz Octacore processor | **Storage**: 64GB or 128GB | **Memory:** 4GB | **Colors**: Gray | **Cameras**: 8MP rear and 8MP front-facing camera | **Weight**: 490 grams | **Dimensions**: 259.1 x 163.7 x 7.50 millimeters | **Connections**: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | **Battery life:** 14 hours

The Fire Max 11 is unlike any Fire tablet before it. It has a gray aluminum housing, a fingerprint reader for unlocking the tablet and signing into apps, and ditches the 3.5mm headphone hack. You can get it with either 64GB or 128GB of storage, both of which can be bolstered by a microSD card of up to 1TB. 

Not only is the 11-inch display -- the biggest Amazon has used in one of its tablets thus far -- part of what makes the Fire Max 11 so attractive, but so too is the $229 starting price for just the tablet. Where things really get interesting for the Fire Max 11, however, is when you look at the productivity bundle Amazon currently sells. For $329, it'l get you a trackpad equipped keyboard that doubles as a kickstand case and a stylus.   
In combination with its accessory suite, the Fire Max 11 is potentially the ultimate productivity-focused tablet, depending on which apps and services you use for work. For example, if you live inside Microsoft's ecosystem of apps and services, you'll find all of them available in the . However, if you use Google's apps and services, you won't find any of those apps available on the Fire Max 11\.

### Amazon Fire 7

#### Best cheap Amazon tablet

**Tech specs: Display**: 7-inch, 1024 x 600 IPS | **Processor**: Quad-core 2.0 GHz | **Storage**: 8/16GB, microSD support up to 1TB | **Memory:** 2GB | **Colors**: Black, denim, rose | **Cameras**: 2MP rear, 2MP front | **Weight**: 9.9 ounces | **Dimensions**: 7.11 x 4.63 x 0.38 inches | **Connections**: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C, microSD slot | **Battery life:** 10 hours

Amazon's Fire 7 tablet was updated in 2022 is the most affordable tablet in the company's lineup. This tablet features a quad-core processor that is 30% faster than the previous generation Fire 7, significantly improving power and ability. The screen is the smallest on our list at just seven inches, but it makes for a more compact package than you would receive with other models like the Amazon Fire HD 10\. 

You can still access top apps with the ten hours of battery life that is included, plus there is the ability to make video calls for all of your personal and professional needs. 

We recommend this one as an inexpensive option for someone who needs a tablet that's used for strictly video calls, keeping kids entertained, or solely as a Kindle eReader, with the bonus of being able to check your email.

Pros 
* Wireless charging
* Relatively affordable
* Reliable battery life

Cons 
* Mediocre camera quality
* Not as rugged as Kids Edition

### Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus

#### Best Amazon tablet for the value

**Tech specs: Display**: 8-inch 1280 x 800 IPS LCD display | **Processor**: MediaTek MT8168 | **Storage**: 32GB or 64GB | **Memory:** 3GB | **Colors**: Gray | **Cameras**: 2 MP front; 2MP wide rear | **Weight**: 12.06 ounces | **Dimensions**: 7.95 x 5.41 x 0.38 inches | **Connectivity:** 3.5mm headphone jack; USB-C | **Battery life:** Up to 12 hours

In his [full length review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-fire-hd-8-plus-2022-review/), ZDNET's June Wan says you're the ideal customer for this tablet if you've "ever wondered what tablet you should buy for casual browsing, mobile entertainment, or even for a child." However, he does warn that the "usual mix of glass and aluminum" that makes up the tablet's design isn't as rugged as the Kids Edition. The plastic edges do give it some grip and durability for everyday bumps and bruises, though. 

However, with solid specs and expandable storage (up to 64GB), it's sufficient for your standard streaming, internet browsing, and game playing needs. And with up to 12 hours of battery life, there's plenty hours of usage, even with Show Mode turned on.

### Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Tablet

#### Best Amazon tablet for kids

**Tech specs: Display:** 8-inch display | **Processor:** Hexa-core 2.0 Ghz | **Storage:** 32GB or 64GB (expandable by up to 1 TB) | **Memory:** 2GB | **Colors:** Blue, purple, Disney Mickey Mouse, or Disney princess **| Cameras:** 2 MP front and rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording | **Weight:** 18.3 ounces | **Dimensions:** 8.7 x 7.1 x 1.1 inches| **Connections:** 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | **Battery life:** 13 hours

The Fire HD 8 Kids Edition is identical to the standard Fire HD 8 in terms of specs and design, but it also comes with features and accessories specific to kids.

The subscription gets you access to thousands of kid-friendly ad-free books, as well as movies and games and other educational content. 

Parents can control screen time and set educational goals for their children using the parental controls built into the tablet to make sure their kid is actually reading or learning something while using it. 

"The Amazon Fire HD 8 is a great, child-friendly tablet for education, games, and entertainment," said ZDNET's Maria Diaz in the bottom line of her [full length review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-bought-this-amazon-kids-tablet-instead-of-an-ipad-and-wasnt-sorry/) after having bought the tablet for her kids.

Pros 
* Wireless charging compatible
* Expandable storage

Cons

### Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus

#### Best mid-range Amazon tablet

**Tech specs: Display**: 10.1-inch 1080p full HD, (1920 x 1200) with over 2 million pixels (224 ppi) display | **Processor**: Octa-core 2.0 GHz | **Storage**: 32GB or 64GB (expandable up to 1TB) | **Memory:** 4GB | **Colors**: Slate | **Cameras**: 2 MP front-facing and 5MP rear-facing cameras with 720p HD video recording | **Weight**: 16.4 ounces | **Dimensions**: 9.73 x 6.53 x 0.36 inches | **Connections**: 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port | **Battery life:** 12 hours

Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus has a 10.1-inch 1080p Full HD display that includes more than two million pixels. With an octa-core processor, there are four gigabytes of RAM to offer convenient storage. Like the Amazon Fire HD 10, there are 12 hours of battery. 

The display also incorporates aluminosilicate glass for far greater durability. This Amazon tablet also permits access to your favorite apps like Netflix and Hulu.

However, the only real difference between the Fire HD 10 and the Fire HD 10 Plus is 4GB of RAM instead of 3GB and that this model is compatible with wireless charging. If those two things are important to you, it might be worth the upgrade.
