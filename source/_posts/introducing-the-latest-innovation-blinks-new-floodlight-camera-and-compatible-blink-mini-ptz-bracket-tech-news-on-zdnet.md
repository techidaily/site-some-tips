Amazon has announced a bunch of new products, including new Echo hardware, new Ring home security cameras, and new Blink devices. Here's [everything Amazon announced at its fall event today](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/everything-amazon-just-announced-and-how-to-buy-it-all/).

Blink, which is owned by Amazon, is known for relatively affordable [home security products](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Outdoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-3cam%2Fdp%2FB086DKSHQ4%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6008dfe7-5099-4a58-aae0-16863f750425%7Cdtp&dtb=1) with long battery life and free video storage. However, the company just unveiled a hardwired [Blink Wired Floodlight Camera](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Wired-Floodlight-Camera%2Fdp%2FB0B5VLCL1N%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6008dfe7-5099-4a58-aae0-16863f750425%7Cdtp&dtb=1), alongside a new [Blink Mini Pan-Tilt Mount](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White%2Fdp%2FB09N6YCT3Y%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6008dfe7-5099-4a58-aae0-16863f750425%7Cdtp&dtb=1). 

[Blink Wired Floodlight Camera $89.99 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B5VLCL1N%2Fref%3Dasc%5Fdf%5FB0B5VLCL1N1724929200000%3Fcreative%3D395261%26creativeASIN%3DB0B5VLCL1N%26linkCode%3Dasn%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6008dfe7-5099-4a58-aae0-16863f750425%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

Availability for the Blink Wired Floodlight Camera wasn't announced outside of a vague statement that it'll be "available in the coming months." However, you can keep an eye on [amazon.com/blink](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fblink%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6008dfe7-5099-4a58-aae0-16863f750425%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

The Blink Mini Pan-Tilt isn't a camera, specifically; instead, it's a motorized mount for the [Blink Mini indoor cam](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlink-Mini-White-1Cam%2Fdp%2FB07X6C9RMF%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6008dfe7-5099-4a58-aae0-16863f750425%7Cdtp&dtb=1). When the two devices are used together, the mount will rotate the Mini cam to provide up to 360-degree coverage of a room. You can use the Blink mobile app to control the camera remotely. 

[Blink Mini Pan-Tilt Mount $19.99 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08Z6MHCBW%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6008dfe7-5099-4a58-aae0-16863f750425%7Cdtp&dtb=1)
