## Unfolding the Battle: Comparative Analysis of Google Pixel 9 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 - A Closer Look

![A comparison photo between the Google Pixel Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/8190d5d15c4ec61b15fb7a1122ddc66e113b7f1d/2024/08/13/f1bed80c-90b2-4427-8945-4f6e8035db85/pixel-fold-vs-samsung-z-fold.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Google just dropped its latest line of [Pixel flagship smartphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-google-phone/), and among them is a new foldable: the [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-9041660-15878894-1723532400000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). It has a brilliant, huge eight-inch screen -- one of the biggest of any smartphone on the market -- and comes with a host of new features Google added to the Pixel line, including [Gemini Live](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-gemini-live-how-googles-real-time-chatbot-competes-with-gpt-4o/) and some cool visual capabilities.

But there's some tough competition out there. [Foldables](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-foldable-phone/) are still a bit of a niche choice in the smartphone market, but they're gaining ground with consumers as they get better. Samsung just released its own new foldable earlier this summer, the [Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-z-fold6%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), and we were [impressed with the Galaxy Z Fold 6's](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-why-samsungs-new-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-a-major-design-success/#link={)[solid design](https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-why-samsungs-new-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-a-major-design-success/) and feature-rich package. 

How does the Galaxy Z Fold 6 compare to Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold? Both Androids start around the same price ($1,799 for the Pixel 9 Fold, $1,899 for the Galaxy Z Fold 6), and each has its own suite of features. We've gone hands-on with both phones and highlighted their key differences below.

##  You should buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if...  

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

###  1\. You want all the visual AI features 

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

While the cameras on both the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 are comparable, Google's phone has some cool new AI-powered apps and camera features that set it apart. During our hands-on demo of the phone, we had a chance to test a few of them out, and if you plan on using your foldable as a visual-first device, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is your best bet. Here are the best ones:

* The **Magic Editor** app comes with a host of improved functions you can apply to your own photos, like Auto Frame, which automatically reframes a photo. It also suggests the best crop and expands your image with generative AI.
* The **Add Me** feature uses AI to combine two photos to ensure that everyone is included in a group shot.
* **Reimagine** uses generative AI to add cool effects to your own photos, letting you change the background of a selfie from your bedroom wall to a beach sunset, for example.
* The **Made You Look** feature plays a bright animation on the phone's outer screen, ensuring your subject will look right at the camera, whether your subject is a kid or a pet.
* **Video Boost**, the Pixel's video upscaling feature, is improved on the 9 Pro. It uses machine learning and Super Res Zoom to enhance videos to 8K, despite the fact that the phone can't shoot at that resolution.

### 2\. You're hyped for Gemini Live

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Google [teased its multimodal AI model at I/O](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-just-demoed-its-multimodal-gemini-live-feature-and-im-worried-for-rabbit-and-humane/) earlier this year, and we've been anticipating its full release ever since. The wait is over with the release of the new Pixel 9 Pro series, although some features (like its multimodal capabilities) are still not quite ready for the launch. 

Despite that fact, Gemini's on-device AI is well-optimized for the Pixel lineup and is integrated as more of an overarching presence than simply a siloed-off standalone app. Gemini will be replacing Google Assistant as the phone's primary AI assistant going forward as well, saying "Let's go live."

Also, if you buy the new Google Pixel 9 phone, you'll get access to the [Google One AI Premium plan for a year for free](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-get-free-access-to-googles-new-ai-subscription-includes-access-to-gemini-advanced-and-the-rebranded-duet-ai-heres-how/) (it'll cost you $20/month after that).

###  3\. You want the biggest screen 

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

One of the best reasons for getting a foldable phone is the big screen, and Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold doesn't skimp. While unfolded, the Super Actua Flex display measures eight inches (almost half an inch larger than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6) and is 80% brighter than the previous Pixel model. It's also one of the thinnest foldables on the market right now, measuring just 0.2 inches thick while fully unfolded.

All that screen real estate makes it a great option for games, web browsing, and video watching, and of course, it pairs well with all the previously mentioned camera and visual apps.

##  You should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if...

###  1\. You have other Samsung devices 

Samsung has pushed for additional functionality within its own ecosystem of products this year, specifically with its new Copilot+ PC, the [Galaxy Book 4 Edge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-samsungs-new-copilot-pc-and-it-stands-out-from-the-crowd-in-3-major-ways/) laptop. The devices integrate well with features like the Plug-in app, which allows you to remotely access and control your phone from the laptop (something [Apple is still developing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-apple-macbook-is-getting-a-free-upgrade-here-are-the-best-macos-15-features/)). 

Samsung also supports app continuity between its devices, allowing for seamless switching of content from the smartphone to the laptop and vice versa. If you have Galaxy Buds, Bluetooth can swap easily between devices with a single click, allowing you to take a call on the phone and then swap back to the laptop.
