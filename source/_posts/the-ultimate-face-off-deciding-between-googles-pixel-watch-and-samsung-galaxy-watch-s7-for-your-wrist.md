## The Ultimate Face-Off: Deciding Between Google's Pixel Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch S7 for Your Wrist

In 2022, Google launched its first [Pixel Watch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-review/). In 2023, the company followed it up with the [Pixel Watch 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-2-review/), which refined the design, improved the battery life, and enhanced the Fitbit integration.

Today, Google unveiled the Pixel Watch 3, which continues the company's incremental improvements in a watch that looks nearly the same as the past two models. There's one major change, however: the addition of a larger size Pixel Watch, which may satisfy you if you found the first two generation watches too small for your wrist.

Last month, Samsung, which has had many more years of working to perfect its wearable, also revealed its newest Android smartwatch, the [Galaxy Watch 7](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on-key-specs-features-and-everything-you-should-know/). Samsung's latest model also offers some minor improvements.

It's good to see both companies achieving near perfection in their smartwatch companions for Android smartphones. To help you better decide between the two, let's take a look at the key differences below.

##  You should buy the Google Pixel Watch 3 if...  

June Wan/ZDNET

###  1\. The deep Fitbit and Google integration appeals to you

Google acquired Fitbit in 2021 and has rolled the Fitbit health and wellness features into its Pixel Watch models. With each new Pixel Watch model, Fitbit features get better, and this year, new readiness and cardio load tracking guides should help you with workouts that are optimized for you and your body. Fitbit Premium should provide personalized, AI-powered run recommendations, while the new Fitbit Morning Brief should deliver you a health and wellness summary when you wake up.

**Also: [How to preorder the new Pixel Watch 3, and the best deals so far](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-preorder-the-new-pixel-watch-3/)**

The promise of a full Google watch starts to become more of a reality thanks to improved integration with Google services. This includes Nest camera and doorbell streams, Google TV remote functionality, offline Google Maps, and improved Google Assistant call handling.

###  2\. You want the best heart rate performance

All smartwatches have an optical heart rate sensor, but the performance can vary wildly. Samsung watches continue to show heart rate readings that are generally higher than other watches. The Google Pixel Watch 2 showed heart rate results that closely matched the best heart rate chest straps, and Google continues to use the same sensor on the Pixel Watch 3.

The smooth, round design of the Pixel Watch helps keep the heart rate sensor against the skin on your wrist, and the option for a larger model may help with the fit for people with larger wrists. The sensor also measures skin conductance (cEDA) for body response tracking, and you will not be disappointed with the performance of the heart rate sensor on the Pixel Watch 3.

###  3\. You like the smooth, pebble design

Although the first two Pixel Watch models were too small for my wrist, I loved the round, subtle design and am pleased to see Google didn't change it. The form factor stands apart from other watches that embrace a more traditional watch case and bezel. The smooth round watch makes it easy to wear while sleeping, which may lead to better sleep data results.

**Also: [Google Pixel Watch 3 vs Pixel Watch 2: Should you upgrade?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2-should-you-upgrade/)**

The design does leave the glass display unprotected, so if you are someone who is known for knocking their wrist against walls and other objects, then the Pixel Watch 3 may not be the best for you. If you want an elegant, simple design, however, you'll love the continued Pixel Watch design language.

##  You should buy the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 if...

###  1\. You own a Samsung smartphone

The Google Pixel Watch 3 will work fine with any Android phone, but the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is optimized for Galaxy smartphones, thanks to new Galaxy AI features and a few other Samsung goodies. If you like your Samsung smartphone and want the optimal wearable experience, the Galaxy Watch 7 is likely the better choice.

**Also: [The best Samsung phones you can buy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-samsung-phone/)**

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 connects to your smartphone through Samsung Health, Samsung Wearable, and Samsung Health Monitor apps.

###  2\. You have lots of standard 20mm watch bands

While the new Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a new proprietary magnetic lug band connection system, the Galaxy Watch 7 continues with a standard 20mm pin connection. There is a massive amount of official Samsung bands and third-party 20mm watch bands available online and at retail stores.

Google also uses a unique band system, so there are only so many available bands. If you spent lots of money on bands for Samsung watches and want to continue to use them, consider the Galaxy Watch 7.

###  3\. You want to monitor yourself for sleep apnea

Samsung offers the Samsung Health Monitor app for the ECG functionality on its watches, and this year the company added a new capability to the Watch 7\. The US FDA cleared the Galaxy Watch 7 to detect sleep apnea. To use this feature, you must wear the watch to sleep for two days for at least four hours of sleep over a 10-day period so that the watch can measure your blood oxygen levels.

**Also: [The best Android smartwatches: Expert tested and reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-smartwatch/)**

Sleep apnea is a condition that obstructs a person's airways while they sleep, and it can cause serious medical issues, including Type 2 diabetes. With early detection, people can visit their health care provider for further evaluation and then develop a care plan to remediate the condition. This is the first smartwatch with this feature. Given the number of people I know who sleep with a mask on due to this condition, I'd say it's a welcome addition to the Galaxy Watch 7.

##  Alternatives to consider 

### BEST GOOGLE ALTERNATIVE

## Google Pixel Watch 2

You can save a bit of money on last year's model with very few compromises in capabilities. The Google Pixel Watch 2 works closely with Fitbit for fitness and health tracking, too.

### BEST RUGGED SMARTWATCH ALTERNATIVE

## Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra

Samsung added a new watch to its lineup in 2024 for those of us with larger wrists. The Watch Ultra is a compelling alternative to the smaller Galaxy Watch 7 and the Google Pixel Watch 3.
