## How to Access the Latest Battery & Memory Saving Functions in Google Chrome: A Step-by-Step Guide

Google Chrome gets better -- a lot better.

Google has [finally rolled out to the mainstream Memory Saver and Energy Saver features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/with-this-google-chrome-update-the-browser-should-stop-draining-your-battery-life/) into the Chrome browser for Windows, MacOS, and ChromeOS.

These features are rolling out to everyone in the latest Chrome 110 update. [I've been using these features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-enable-energy-saver-mode-on-google-chrome/) since they were rolled out as experimental features in Chrome 108, and I have to say that I'm impressed by the improvements they bring. 

But I'm hearing from several users who aren't seeing the settings for these features.

**Also:** [**If you use Google Chrome, you need to install this feature now**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/if-you-use-google-chrome-you-need-to-install-this-now/)

Don't worry, here's how to switch them on. 

## How to find Google Chrome's new battery and memory saver features

## 1\. Make sure you're running Chrome 110

You can check which version you are on by going to the browser's settings and choosing About Chrome, or by typing the following into the address bar and pressing Enter:

_chrome://settings/help_

If you are not yet running version 110 or higher, you need to update (which you can do from the screen that gives you the version information).

One rub here is that [Google is dropping support for Windows 7 and Windows 8](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-110-arrives-but-not-all-windows-pcs-will-get-it/) with this release, so if you're still using these aging operating systems, you don't get this update.

This version of Chrome -- Chrome 110 -- is up to date.

## 2\. Check your Settings for Performance

Click on the three dots, then **Settings**, and look for **Performance** in the left-hand column. 

If it's there, you're good. 

**Also:** [**3 Google Chrome extensions to boost productivity that I'd never heard of before**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/three-google-chrome-productivity-boosting-extensions-id-never-heard-of-before/)

Note that the **Battery Saver** feature only shows up on laptops.

If it's not there, read on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## 3\. No Performance? Do this

OK, still not seeing **Performance** or the **Memory Saver** and **Battery Saver** in **Settings**?

* To display **Memory Saver**, type the following into the address bar and press Enter:  
_chrome://flags/#high-efficiency-mode-available_  
Change the drop-down box to **Enabled**.
* To display **Battery Saver** (only do this for laptops), type the following into the address bar and press Enter:  
_chrome://flags/#battery-saver-mode-available_  
Change the drop-down box to **Enabled**.

After making these changes, you'll need to relaunch the browser (you can click on the button that will appear at the bottom on the page to do this).

These are the settings that need to be changed to Enabled.

## 4\. Check your settings again

After the browser fires back up, go back into Chrome's **Settings**. You should see **Performance** and the settings you just enabled in there.

**Also:** [**These 3 free Google Google Chrome extensions can save you time**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/these-3-free-google-chrome-extensions-can-save-you-time-in-2023/)

Also, check that the settings are enabled. If not, you can flip the toggle to switch them on.
