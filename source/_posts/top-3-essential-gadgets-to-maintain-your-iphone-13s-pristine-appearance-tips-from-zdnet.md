### Your first line of defense!

I find that iPhone screens [scratch pretty easily](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-want-an-iphone-that-doesnt-do-this/). So this time around, I've made the decision to use a screen protector.

But I hate applying screen protectors.

This is why I've been on the lookout for screen protectors that are easy to apply, and that's where the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector comes in. The process is simple: The screen protector arrives in a plastic frame. You clean your screen, peel off the backing on the screen protector, pop the frame over the iPhone, press the film down, remove the frame, and finally remove the top layer.

It's quick and easy!

And you get two in the pack in case you mess up the first time.

### All-around protection

Earlier this year, I was looking for a new car mount for my iPhone. I kept hearing good things about Quad Lock, so I decided to give them a go.

I've never looked back.

Quad Lock has a range of accessories, from cases to car mounts to motorcycle mounts. They're all high-quality products blow the competition away.

I had concerns that this case wouldn't offer the same protection that other cases offer, but after dropping my iPhone many times, it seems that my fears were unfounded.

Every Quad Lock accessory I've tested since then has been of the highest quality.

### Ultimate protection

You have a case. You have a screen protector. What more could you want?

A poncho.

While this is not vital for everyone, if you regularly take your iPhone into the great outdoors, the Quad Lock poncho offers another layer of protection.

It covers the screen, the cameras, and the ports. The great thing is that the touchscreen and Face ID both work fine when using the poncho!
