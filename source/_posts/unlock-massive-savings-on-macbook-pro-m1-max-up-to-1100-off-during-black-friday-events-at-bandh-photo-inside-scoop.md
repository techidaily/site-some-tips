Along with the M1 Max CPU, the MacBook Pro 16 is built with 32GB of RAM, a 32-core on-chip GPU, and a 1TB SSD. The 16.2-inch display uses Apple's Liquid Retina XDR technology to produce bold colors and deep contrasts. It also has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, so you can easily see your work, webpage, or video in harsh overhead lighting and even in broad daylight. And if your storage needs change, the MacBook Pro M1 Max can support up to 8TB of storage for all the room you'll need for raw video, photo, and 3D model files.

The built-in speakers work with Dolby Atmos to create virtual surround sound for a more immersive experience while listening to music or streaming shows and movies.
