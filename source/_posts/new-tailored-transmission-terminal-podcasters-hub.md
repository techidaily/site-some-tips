Podcasts with poor audio quality are unpleasant. So the audio production quality is essential. If you want to take your podcasting to the next level, it’s time to invest in a decent audio interface device. These devices improve your recording quality and are very easy to get started with.

But what is an audio interface, and how does it work? In this article, we’ll take a look at the audio interface and why it’s essential to anyone trying to record audio.

## Part 1\. What are audio interfaces for podcasting?

![audio interfaces](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-1.jpg)

Audio interfaces are unnecessary, complicated gadgets for some people. Others see them as an essential piece of gear to enhance the music experience.

It is a device that converts digital signals from a computer into analog signals. These analog signals can then be recorded and played back on another audio source. This includes microphones and instruments. They have become a necessity in the world of music recording and editing.

The audio interface has a lot to offer. It records and playbacks audio on various devices and is useful for recording:

1. Podcasts
2. Streaming music
3. Even making phone calls on a computer.

### Main functions

Here are the main functions of an audio interface.

* It allows you to connects with external devices and record audio from multiple sources. Here are these external devices:  
  * A microphone  
  * Computer’s line-in  
  * Mixer,  
  * An instrument amp,  
  * Keyboard
* It lets your playback audio files recorded previously on a computer.
* It can control external devices' volume, pan, mute, and more.

## Part 2\. What does an audio interface do for a podcast?

If you are looking for ways to record and create podcasts, you should consider investing in an audio interface. An audio interface is one of the first things you’ll need to record your podcasts.

This is one of those things that sounds like an obvious thing to buy, but if you don’t already have one, you should consider buying one.

The Pros and Cons of Recording with an Audio interface:

 Pros

* Offers better quality sound
* Control your recording environment
* Add a second microphone
* Add sound effects

 Cons

* Requires more space to set up

The Pros and Cons of Recording with a USB microphone:

 Pros

## Part 3\. Is an audio interface a must for podcasters?

No, since without an audio interface, the recording could be done manually through other means. Therefore, the audio interface helps you record podcast episodes with better quality and higher fidelity, making it easier for listeners to hear your voice.

**This means an audio interface is not needed to record a podcast or voiceover but is recommended.** With any audio editing or recording, you must ensure that your audio interfaces work in tandem with your computer sound card.

### What does “better audio quality” mean?

“A better audio quality” means you can understand people’s voices more clearly. A sound recorded or reproduced in such a way as to have improved clarity or intelligibility over existing recordings, or to provide greater depth of perception.” In other words, it describes an improvement.

Listening to someone speaking over the phone while trying to talk to them in person, their voice may sound garbled. Because noise surrounds the person’s mouth, creating a distortion in their voice that makes it impossible to decipher who is saying what.

### Which parameters determine “better audio quality”?

A microphone records sound waves, and digitization processes the sound waves and converts them into digital data called parameters. The main parameters include

**Sample Rate**

This is how many audio samples are being recorded per second. Frequency response is the response of a signal to the input. The higher the sample rate, the more information, and detail in the sound.

For example, 44100 (44.1kHz) samples per second are considered good quality.

![sample rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-2.jpg)

**Bit Depth**

Bit depth controls the dynamic range of the recording and measures how many bits of information can be recorded for each sample.

The lowest bit depth you should use for professional recordings is 16-bit, but many digital audio recorders offer up to 32-bit floating settings with a higher dynamic range.

## Part 6\. Additional essential podcasting equipment for a podcast show

Most people aren’t aware that so much more equipment is required to put on a podcast than simply a microphone. Whether audio-recording software or a mixing board, many pieces of equipment are necessary to produce quality audio and video content. Here are the most important equipment needed to create a good podcast.

### Microphone and Stand

![microphone and stand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-7.jpg)

One of the first things you need to get started podcasting is a good microphone, and a quality tripod stands for it. When you’re recording podcasts, you want to ensure you’re getting the best sound. To do so, you need a high-quality microphone that should be durable yet comfortable.

The microphone stand is also one of the essential pieces of audio equipment, as it is used to hold the mic in an optimal position to ensure that the sound quality is at its best.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
The mixer is the most important piece of equipment for a podcast because it is used for recording and mixing audio. It allows you to adjust the volume of individual mics, which makes it possible to add multiple mics to your podcast. It also allows you to adjust the volume of the overall podcast.

### Headphones

![headphones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-9.jpg)

Headphones are required if you want to listen to podcasts during your commute. And the best ones for you depend on what kind of audio quality you prefer. A good pair of headphones will last you a long time. They are either wired or wireless; we recommend choosing wired over wireless because they offer low latency and are cheaper than wireless.

### Sound Card

![sound-card](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-10.jpg)

Sound cards are vital tools in podcast production. They offer two key features: quality audio and plug-and-play compatibility. A good sound card will have some form of digital audio output, such as optical or USB, allowing your sound card to feed recorded audio to any device, regardless of brand.
