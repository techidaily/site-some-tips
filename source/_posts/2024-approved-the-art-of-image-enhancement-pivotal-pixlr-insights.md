### 5\. Add Double Exposure

This technique is usually applied to merge two layers and exposures on a single image.

### 8\. Explore Borders and Stickers

What makes images exciting and inviting? Borders and funny stickers can help to enhance your images effortlessly.

### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays
