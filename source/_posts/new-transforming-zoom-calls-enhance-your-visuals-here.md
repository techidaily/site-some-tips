## Transforming Zoom Calls: Enhance Your Visuals Here

Our lives became internet-dependent, especially during Pandemic times. You must have tried things that you have never done before. Pandemic time was the toughest time of all. This is because no one knew what was required to tackle the situation. The schools, offices, universities, everything was shifted to online from the regular physical mode.

During this unpredicted situation, we came across various things and platforms that were nearly non-existent before this. Zoom Meetings are among one of those. This article will discuss in detail Zoom Meetings and Zoom video resolution.

#### In this article

01 [Step by Step Guide to Help You Improve Zoom Video Quality](#part1)

02 [Advanced Tips to Use Zoom Like a Pro](#part2)

## Part 1\. Step by Step Guide to Help You Improve Zoom Video Quality

[Zoom Meetings](https://zoom.us/) is a top-rated tool widely used for video conferencing. As mentioned earlier, the Pandemic era was the hardest time; many changes took place. One great change was that schools, offices, and universities were being managed from home. Zoom Meetings were the most popular medium to communicate and work during this tough time.

Although the tool is very famous for its services, it has never been known for its video quality. If you want to improve the video quality and Zoom recording resolution, keep reading; this section will share various methods.

### 1\. Low Light Adjustment

As we said earlier that Zoom is known for its video conferencing but not its video quality. People don't know that the video quality could be improved from within Zoom Meetings. The number 1 way is to enable its Low Light Adjustments.

With this setting feature, your video quality remains balanced even if you don’t have enough light. By using this software optimization technique, Zoom Meetings automatically brightens your videos. Follow the steps shared below to enable this setting feature.

### Step 1: Open Video Settings Tab

To enable Low Light Adjustment, first of all, click on your Zoom profile picture and then select the 'Settings' option. From the Settings menu list, go for the option of 'Video.'

### Step 2: Enable the Low Light Setting

First, from the Video section, look for the ‘Adjust for Low Light’ option. Toggle on this option, and then Zoom Meetings will spontaneously adjust the low light settings.

### Step 3: Manual Settings

You can also set the Low Light settings manually. For this, you have to select the 'Manual' option from the toggle button. A manual slider will show up on the screen to set the brightness.

### 2\. Enable HD

The first thing that should be enabled on Zoom Meetings is high-quality video. Who doesn’t like their video to be clear with the high definition? You can achieve this with Zoom Meetings HD video. With its HD video quality, you can stream in 720p or 1080p.

Surprisingly you can achieve HD quality videos on Zoom Meetings from its settings by activating it. Many of you have no idea about this, so let us guide you on how this could be done.

### Step 1: Open Settings Section

To open the Settings. Firstly, click on your profile picture, available at the top right corner. A list will open up with this; select the 'Settings' option from that list. You can also open ‘Settings’ by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner.

### 3\. Studio Effects

You could do any possible thing to improve your Zoom video resolution. You can also add Studio Effects to your video if it increases and improves the video quality. This is not the best solution, but if it works, you can try it. With Zoom Meetings, you can apply different effects to your appearance. Stay with us to learn this step by step.

### Step 3: Download Studio Effects

Then, move to the bottom of the screen. You will see an option of 'Studio Effects'; select that. At this point, Zoom will ask you to Download the Studio Effects. You can hit the ‘Download’ button to do that.
