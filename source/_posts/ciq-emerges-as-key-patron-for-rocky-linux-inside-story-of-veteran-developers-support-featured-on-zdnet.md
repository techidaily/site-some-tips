## CIQ Emerges as Key Patron for Rocky Linux: Inside Story of Veteran Developers' Support | Featured on ZDNet

[CIQ](https://ciq.co/) is a relatively new company. Its leadership, however, has deep roots in open-source software and Linux. Besides Gregory M. Kurtzer, CIQ's co-founder and CEO, who was a creator of [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), the popular [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) clone, its [new executive team](https://ciq.co/linux-and-open-source-veterans-sign-on-to-form-ciq-leadership-team/) \-- announced Wednesday -- boasts two of the founders of [Linuxcare](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/linuxcare), the first company to make supporting Linux a priority. 

CIQ and Rocky Linux founder Gregory M. Kurtzer.

Rocky Linux

Today, the first business model that comes to mind for Linux or open-source software is to offer paid business support. It wasn't always that way. In Linux's early days, companies such as [Caldera](https://www.zdnet.com/article/caldera-ipo-launch/), [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en), and [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/) still thought you could make money by selling Linux in a box to ordinary users. 

Before Red Hat figured this out, when it [retired Red Hat Linux in favor of the commercial RHEL in 2003](https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-celebrates-10-years-of-red-hat-enterprise-linux/), Linuxcare had already emerged as the first important Linux support company in 1998\. Unfortunately, [business problems and the dot-com crash didn't allow Linuxcare](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linuxcares-near-death-experience/) to become a top company. As the saying goes, [first movers lose, second movers win](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/first-mover-advantage/). 

But, that water is well over the dam now. Today, former Linuxcare founders Art Tyde, CIQ's VP of business development, and David LaDuke, VP of marketing, bring decades of hard-won experience to the table. Other well-known veteran technology leaders such as Robert Adolph, co-founder and chief product officer; Rob Dufalo, SVP of engineering; John Frey, CTO; Stephen Moody, SVP support and technology; Marlin Prager, CFO; and Brock Taylor, VP of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and strategic partners, have joined them. 

**Also:** [**Rocky Linux arrived with everything you need to replicate the distro**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/rocky-linux-9-arrives-with-everything-you-need-to-replicate-the-distro-on-your-own/)

Many tech businesses are under the delusion that only the young can make a difference. Indeed, many believe that if [you're over 40, you're too old for tech](https://www.fastcompany.com/90504623/tech-has-an-ageism-problem-here-are-3-things-to-do-if-youre-over-40-and-want-to-stay-relevant). 

Wrong! CIQ values maturity and experience over youth and exuberance. And since [CIQ recently secured $26 million](https://www.zdnet.com/article/rocky-linux-developer-lands-26m-funding-for-enterprise-open-source-push/) in Series A funding led by [Two Bear Capital](https://twobearcapital.com/), it's not the only one that thinks it's on the right track.

[Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/), CIQ and the [Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation](https://rockylinux.org/)'s free CentOS Linux clone, is proving to be massively successful. It's reached Linux distro image downloads of up to 750,000 a month. But CIQ isn't betting its future on being a Linux distro provider.

True, CIQ offers Rocky Linux support. But it also has several HPC offerings. These include [Warewulf](https://ciq.co/warewulf/), cluster management and operating system provisioning for HPC; [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/), a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)\-supported HPC container open-source project; [Traditional HPC](https://ciq.co/traditional-hpc/), a Rocky Linux and Warewulf-based HPC approach for in-house servers; and Fuzzball: HPC-2.0, an HPC designed to work on the cloud. 

It's going to be interesting to see how well this all works. Personally, I'm expecting this bet on experience and hard-won wisdom to be successful.
