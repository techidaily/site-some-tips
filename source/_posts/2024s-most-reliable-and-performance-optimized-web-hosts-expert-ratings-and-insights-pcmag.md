## 2024'S Most Reliable and Performance-Optimized Web Hosts: Expert Ratings & Insights | PCMag

If you want to build a website, there are dozens of web hosting providers you can turn to. Choosing the right web hosting service for you can be challenging, but you no longer need to be a programmer or pay someone to build advanced features such as e-commerce or forum management to launch a website.

Today, many web providers offer these functions, as well as a content management system (CMS) and other features like SEO assistance and security checks, in standard subscription packages -- and for an affordable price. 

Below, you will find our top recommendations for web hosting services, ranging from providers that give you a quick and easy way to build your website all the way up to companies that provide full data center infrastructure capabilities as a service.

Pros 
* Inexpensive
* One-click WordPress install
* AI tools

Cons 
* Enhanced security limited to more expensive plans
* Prices jump on renewal

### Hostinger

#### Best web hosting service overall

Hostinger's premium plan ($2.99/month, three months free) is excellent value for the money if you want to operate multiple websites for personal or business reasons under one account.

The premium plan supports up to 100 websites. It offers users 100GB storage, up to 100 email addresses and forwarders, free SSL website security, and unlimited bandwidth, and a free domain name. 

While there's no dedicated IP address, this won't bother most website owners. Furthermore, you'll be given basic e-commerce capabilities and one-click WordPress installation and migration. The same WordPress installation can be used to support multiple WordPress websites. 

**Review:** [**Hostinger review: Good support, killer entry-level price web hosting**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hostinger-review-web-hosting/)

If you need a theme, Hostinger also provides a drag-and-drop website builder and 150 templates. The plan includes Google Analytics integration, SEO tools, and standard DDoS protection. 

Overall, we consider Hostinger's premium plan an excellent option for most website owners and small businesses. Business options begin at $2.99/month with three months added, for free.

A downside, however, is that you can only access more advanced features -- such as daily backups and increased performance -- with more expensive subscriptions. In addition, while many customers applaud Hostinger's customer service, there are reports of bounceback and slow loads by some clients operating multiple websites.

There is a limited, free plan available, with 300MB storage but no free domain or email.

**Hostinger features:** **cPanel**: Yes | **SSL**: Some plans | **SSH**: Yes | **Backups**: Yes | **Money-back guarantee**: 30 days | **Support**: 24/7, live chat support

### DreamHost

#### Best web hosting service for professionals

DreamHost's easy-to-use interface, efficiency, and customer support stand out to business owners and new webmasters alike. The hosting provider offers WordPress hosting, shared hosting, virtual private servers, dedicated servers, cloud hosting, and more. 

We particularly like that [DreamHost](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dreamhost-review/) offers G Suite integration, with domain integration and Google Cloud support. The company also provides a great set of resources and guides that can help customers grow their businesses, all in a cost-effective way. A free SSL certificate is available on all plans. 

**Review:** [**DreamHost review: I'm a satisfied 15-year customer**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dreamhost-review/)

Nick Farnborough, the co-founder of [Clavis Social](http://clavis.ca/), told ZDNET that he has "tried almost every host out there over the years and ultimately found DreamHost to be the best overall package, taking into account cost, performance, and ease of use." 

Customers online, too, have applauded the customer support and value for money of this web host, although some also note that reaching customer support teams can be challenging. Prices begin at $2.95 per month for a basic, shared plan, with email available for an additional monthly fee.

**DreamHost features** **:** **cPanel**: No, proprietary panel | **SSL**: Free | **SSH**: Yes | **Backups**: Yes | **Money-back guarantee**: 97 days | **Support**: 24/7 chat, ticket, and call-back

Pros 
* Scalable
* Affordable plans

Cons 
* Paid plans can become expensive following promotion time periods

### Ionos

#### Best budget web hosting service

Ionos is one of our top picks for affordable, long-term web hosting. The web hosting provider offers reliable, stable uptime with daily backups included on all plans. Free wildcard SSL certificates, email, a free domain, and 24/7 support are also included. 

Customers report great customer service, uptime, easy setup, and web hosting transitions. 

Basic plans supporting one website and with 10 databases, alongside 10GB storage space, are typically $6/month, but with the agreement of a three-year plan, will cost you $4/month. A free domain name for one year is included. 

The top deal at the moment is for Ionos Plus, a website hosting package suitable for larger, scalable projects and WordPress. On a three-year plan, you will only pay $6/month and you can operate unlimited websites with unlimited databases and storage. You will also receive a wildcard SSL certificate.

Pros 
* Reasonably priced
* Eco-friendly
* Long MBG

Cons 
* On-demand backups limited to premium plans

### GreenGeeks

#### Best web hosting service for the environmentally-conscious

GreenGeeks is a great web hosting option if you want to sign up for a sustainable, eco-conscious service.

GreenGeeks has developed its marketing around the concept of being environmentally friendly, with three times the power your hosting demands replaced with wind power credits and tree planting. 

It's not just the environmental factor, however -- GreenGeeks prides itself on a speedy, reliable service. Although the company's own website could use some modernization and an overhaul, the important part is the hosting, which includes standard hosting, WordPress installs, commerce, VPS, and dedicated tiers. 

You can expect to pay $2.95/month for basic plans, with options to upscale and grow over time. The basic web hosting plan only covers one website with 50GB storage, but once you move up a level, you can expect support for unlimited websites, managed WordPress installs, unlimited space, a free SSL certificate, and more. 

Customers applaud GreenGeeks' customer service, although there are reports of "hidden" fees related to specific products.

**GreenGeeks f** **eatures:** **cPanel**: Yes | **SSL**: Free | **SSH**: Yes | **Backups**: Varies by plan | **Money-back guarantee**: 30 days | **Support**: Depends on plan

Pros 
* Free, unlimited SSL for all websites on the Deluxe plan and up
* Tutorials online to help guide your website-creating process

Cons 
* Large payment down to start hosting

### GoDaddy

#### Best web hosting service for GoDaddy domain customers

GoDaddy has offered as wide an array of services as possible for individuals and small businesses needing an internet presence. It's widely known, and many customers enjoy the service.

GoDaddy is a great option if you prefer to stick with a well-known brand. It's also recently introduced AI-based services to help you find the right domain name and to assist you with branding. 

Pricing begins at $5.99/month for one website. Specific plans may qualify you for a free domain name and SSL certificate. Regarding security, automatic WordPress updates are applied, and malware scanning services are available. Each plan comes with a one-click WordPress installation, a cPanel, and daily backups. 

**Review:** [**GoDaddy: A no muss, no fuss website-building service**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/godaddy-websites-marketing-review/)

Customer service is reasonable, and, although not 24/7, if you need a technical lead to get something accomplished, you can usually find someone with a clue (after jumping through a few hoops, of course). However, the refund policy is restrictive and I would say the host's website is cluttered, making it difficult to find exactly what service you need -- and for what price.

ZDNET author David Gewirtz has decades of experience with GoDaddy, and he has come to respect how this web host provides the key services most customers want. They're definitely not the best at anything, but they do a good job with almost everything. 

"GoDaddy, in my opinion, is the best web host," Gerrid Smith, director of E-commerce of [Joy Organics](https://joyorganics.com/collections/creams), told ZDNET. "They promise a minimum of 99.9% availability. To prevent malicious activities and repel DDoS attacks, their security team works around the clock."

**GoDaddy f** **eatures:** **cPanel**: Some plans | **SSL**: Some plans | **SSH**: Some plans | **Backups**: Some plans | **Money-back guarantee**: 30 days for annual plans, 48 hours for monthly plans | **Support**: 24/7/365 US-based ticket and phone

Pros 
* Lots of templates to choose from for beginner web designers
* Simple interface
* Website apps available with Wix support

Cons 
* Monthly plans are expensive
* Can't switch templates, must start from scratch

### Wix

#### Best web hosting service for simple e-commerce

If you've ever watched a YouTube video, you've seen a Wix ad. They are everywhere. With six million premium subscribers, they've got some momentum -- and are certainly capable of grabbing attention.

When selecting a website builder, why would you go with Wix over WordPress? The answer is simplicity. WordPress offers tremendous depth and customization options with plugins and widgets, but Wix quickly gets you up and running with an attractive site. 

There is nothing like the thousands of plugins and themes offered by WordPress in the Wix world, but if you want a well-designed site and you need an e-commerce solution, this is a great option. 

I selected this provider when I assisted someone in setting up a small online business, and the learning curve was easy, with no payment or downtime issues. However, for someone used to CMS backends, the more restrictive website builder can be somewhat frustrating.

Free versions, however, do contain Wix banners. You can start there, and if you like the system, convert to a paid plan and link up your chosen domain name. Plans begin at $17/month with a free domain name thrown in.

**Wix f** **eatures:** **cPanel**: No | **SSL**: Free | **SSH**: No | **Backups**: Site history | **Money-back guarantee**: 14 days | **Support**: 24/7 English call-back

## Factors to consider when choosing a web hosting service

When selecting your new web hosting provider in 2024, there are some crucial factors you should consider:

* **Reliability**: We always recommend you choose a web hosting provider with a long history of stable, reliable service. After all, your website could end up being the central hub of your business for promotion and customer communication, so constant downtime can harm your reputation.
* **Affordability**: Your budget must be based on the purpose of your web hosting package. Whether you want a single, small slice of hosting real estate for a personal blog or you want to run a large e-commerce store, it will change how much you should expect to pay. Set a budget you can easily afford and find the right provider to match you.
* **Scalability**: You need to consider the most important functions or uses of your website. If you expect to grow your business over time and you expect heavy traffic, you will need to be able to scale the hosting's capabilities over time. Choose a provider with upgrade options.
* **Customer support**: We find that customer support can be extremely important when you sign up for a web hosting service. Whether you are a beginner or want to run a plethora of websites, you should choose a provider with customer support options.

## How did we choose these web hosting services?

When we compiled this list, we began with web hosts ZDNET authors are personally familiar with. ZDNET does extensive testing on and research into web hosting providers, taking into consideration user reviews, competitor analysis, personal usage and experiences, and more.

Some of us have been running production websites for decades, with sites that have served millions of pages. Others have used web hosts for personal blogs, writing projects, and to help individuals launch small businesses. 

We chose these providers because we believe they offer some of the best services in the market. These are the main factors we considered:

* **Features offered**: Deciding on the best web hosting provider for you requires you to consider what features are a priority. We've included options for CMS implementation, e-commerce, design services, SEO services, cybersecurity functions, and more.
* **Price**: Naturally, the price point is a very important factor when we choose our web hosting provider recommendations. We have included options suitable for varying budgets, all the way from personal blogs to small businesses and large enterprise setups that will need to scale.
* **Stability**: We have included only reputable web hosting providers that provide stable services with minimal downtime. After all, there's no point in having a speedy, responsive website if downtime is a constant problem.
* **Customer experiences**: If you are going to sign up for a long-term web hosting service, you need to know how the company treats and supports its customers. We have examined customer reviews and feedback.

## Which web host is best for beginners?

Wix and Squarespace are the two web hosts we would recommend for beginners. With an abundance of creative templates between the two platforms, users can gain experience in web development with an attractive site. If you have experience with CMS platforms, you could look at WordPress.com.

## Can you get web hosting for free?

Yes. There are many sites that allow for free hosting, but to do so, you will have a generic, branded domain. For example, if you were to have a free WordPress website, your domain would be \[yourwebsitename\].wordpress.com. 

Be careful, though. Many of the free offers end after a period of time and then you're stuck on a service that will likely charge you a considerable additional fee to keep using it. Or, the website host may allow you to have a free website on the condition that you allow adverts to be displayed.

## Who is the largest web hosting company?

GoDaddy is one of the most popular web hosting service providers. Then, of course, there are the hosting plans from Amazon and Google, which are larger (in terms of revenue) than some countries.

## What are the best WordPress hosting services?

We might as well get WordPress out of the way since if we're talking web hosts, we're going to talk WordPress. About [63% of websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) with content management systems use [the open-source WordPress CMS](https://wordpress.org/). 

The WordPress ecosystem is huge, and finding the right WordPress host is a challenge on its own. Beyond WordPress.com, the service offered by the creators of the CMS, there are a large number of managed hosting providers and an even larger number of hosting providers that specialize in providing a WordPress-optimized server for your website. Nearly every hosting provider will allow a WordPress install, considering its popularity.

## What are the best Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers?

Our recommendations include IaaS providers you probably know intimately, such as Amazon. They are highly credible vendors who've been providing infrastructure for years.

If you're just starting, you might not want to go all-in with an IaaS provider, although they offer the most flexibility. Some, like Amazon and Digital Ocean, allow you to point-and-click configure virtual WordPress machines or almost any other open-source content management system you may want. It might be overkill for SMBs, though.

## What are the best point-and-click website builders?

A website builder is a type of software that lets you craft your business website, generally without programming knowledge or experience. Many allow you to choose from templates and then modify those templates to suit your look and layout.

Nearly all web hosting providers include some kind of website-building software. But for most hosting plans, it's often an afterthought. By contrast, the website builders listed in this section are provided by web hosting services that have made point-and-click website building tools with excellent customer support and solid up-time a core priority in their offering. 

You do sacrifice some control when choosing a website builder solution, but if you've never done any web development and you want a beautiful, usable website quickly, these services are for you. One warning: There are a lot of lock-ins here. You won't be able to transfer the look of your site (and sometimes the content) to another hosting provider easily. So keep that in mind when you choose a website builder. 

## What is the difference between a web host and a web server?

A web host is a service provider, such as Wix or GoDaddy, that provides the space, storage, and resources required to keep a website online, typically under a rental agreement. A web server is a computer system that stores files and shares them to become accessible to the web.

## Are there alternative web hosting services to consider?

There are countless web hosting providers out there, and not all of them can make the list of our top recommendations, despite offering excellent service. Below, you will find other hosts to consider that may be more suitable for your requirements:
