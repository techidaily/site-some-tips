#### _Document checking service business deploys ABBYY’s text recognition technology in its identity validation solution_

ABBYY, a leading global provider of technologies and solutions to action information, announced that [TrustID](http://trustid.co.uk/ "TrustID Website"), a provider of IT-based solutions for validation of personal identification documents, has chosen ABBYY OCR technology to power its TrustID Cloud service. Private and public-sector customers can use this service to validate ID documents presented to them and easily detect possible fraudulent actions.

TrustID Cloud was created to meet the needs of companies looking to process identity documents remotely. Typical scenarios include onboarding new customers, employees or tenants by scanning or photographing personal identification documents, such as passports, driving licences, biometric residence permits or visas. These images are uploaded into the TrustID Cloud for checking to support legal compliance with Right to Rent and Right to Work legislation, as well as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) for financial services. The integrated ABBYY OCR technology is used to extract the name, date of birth, document number and other data, enabling the TrustID software to perform an automated validation check. The validation results appear to the user within just a few seconds.

“_A visual inspection of identity documents often leads to inconsistencies in the level of checking. This may mean that suspicious documents are more likely to be missed, resulting in an organisation not being compliant with legal requirements_,” said David Park, Commercial Director of TrustID. “_The fast and robust checks of TrustID Cloud quickly solve this challenge and ABBYY is the perfect match in this process. The excellent quality of ABBYY OCR software means that the data is extracted from identity documents with the highest accuracy. Therefore, the demand for human interaction is greatly reduced. This allows us to control our processing costs while maintaining excellent service and high levels of compliance and security._”

The TrustID Cloud solution meets the needs of customers looking to quickly process identity documents, even when working remotely. It offers the flexibility of a scalable system that is easy to deploy.

ABBYY offers its premium OCR technology for integration to independent software vendors, system integrators and business process outsources. The [ABBYY FineReader Engine](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) software development kit allows them to integrate optical text recognition technologies into their applications.The ABBYY recognition platform delivers award-winning OCR, intelligent character recognition (ICR), barcode, checkmark, field-level/zonal recognition and PDF conversion. It enables scanned documents and images to be automatically transformed into searchable and editable document formats.

“_ABBYY OCR technology adds value to applications used across many sectors. ID check is an important topic for organisations and TrustID’s cloud solution provides a high level of security to them_,” said Sven Diedrich, Director Business Unit Technology Licensing at ABBYY. “_We’re pleased to be helping TrustID take the next step towards reaching a wider market and making their services automated, more efficient and thus attractive for their customers.”_
