Many people pursue Microsoft careers due to their perks and the company's reputation. The competition means applying can be intimidating, whether you're a recent college graduate or making a career change.

Passion and an impressive background aren't always enough to land the role you want. But you may land the job you want if you know what the company is looking for and align yourself with those values.

This guide can help you market yourself as a desirable new hire for Microsoft. 

## What types of tech careers does Microsoft offer?

Microsoft employs people in many roles, including software engineers, product managers, designers, coders, and more. 

The company has implemented [work-from-home](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/improve-focus-while-you-work-from-home/) flexibility for most of its staff and flexible work hours to suit their employees' needs.

If you're a student or recent graduate, Microsoft also offers [tech internships](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/tech-internships/), including UX design, supply chain, IT operations, finance, sales, and many types of engineering. These internships are difficult to earn but may provide future career opportunities.

## Where should I apply for Microsoft careers?

You can submit [job applications](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/tech-job-application-guide/) on the Microsoft website, LinkedIn, or many [different job search sites.](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/job-search-sites-for-tech/) Applying directly to the Microsoft website won't increase your chances of getting hired. Pick whatever site works best for you.

Referrals are a great way to get your resume noticed at Microsoft — though you can still get hired without one. If you don't know any current Microsoft employees, you can use LinkedIn as a networking tool and connect with recruiters. 

Microsoft recruiters may attend hiring events for students and recent grads. Check with your school's career services center for the next recruitment event. 

## What does Microsoft look for in an ideal candidate?

Microsoft looks for individuals who align with their core values, have technical knowledge, and can think on their feet. 

Self-awareness and determination prove to Microsoft that you can work well in teams and persevere if you run into technical issues.

For coding roles, Microsoft looks for individuals with top tech skills like [Microsoft Azure](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-azure-everything-you-need-to-know/), software engineering, SQL, [Python](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-python-is-slow-but-its-about-to-get-faster/), and Microsoft C#.

## How to meet Microsoft's expectations when applying for a tech role

Many [big tech companies](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/big-tech-companies-job-guide/) use a similar process to screen a candidate's educational background, LinkedIn profile, resume, and portfolio.

It's important to make a good impression, so prepare thoroughly before submitting your application.

**LinkedIn profile**

Microsoft purchased LinkedIn for $26 billion in 2016 and uses it as a key part of sourcing new hires. 

Update your profile with a new photo and use your LinkedIn summary to sell yourself to recruiters.

Refresh your profile frequently and match keywords to job postings you're interested in. Use language that recruiters and hiring software search for. 

**Resume**

Read now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/writing-a-standout-cyber-security-resume/)

Remember that your resume will likely be scanned by an applicant tracking system. This software filters applications by searching them for keywords. 

Make it easy for the software to read by using both long-form and acronyms of keywords, using traditional fonts, and avoiding tables and columns.

Tailor your resume to the specific role you're applying for. Use keywords from the job description and only include your relevant work experience. A [software engineer resume](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/how-to-write-a-software-engineer-resume/) should be completely different from a sales or marketing resume. 

Stick to a basic resume template with a reverse-chronological format to make your resume more appealing to the software — and the people performing the second screening.

**Online portfolio (if applicable)**

All coding professionals should have a portfolio and update it frequently to demonstrate their coding abilities. You can house your [coding portfolio](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/how-to-build-a-coding-portfolio/) on a website like GitHub or your website. 

Your portfolio should reflect both your biggest strengths and the skills commonly required by the positions you're pursuing.

Ensure your profile includes your coding projects, contact information, and a brief bio.

## Microsoft's interview stages

As of June 2022, Microsoft's interview process is [entirely virtual](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/interviewtips). If you need to request disability-related accommodations during the process, fill out [this form](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/accommodationrequest).

**Phone screener**

Tech companies typically start the process with a phone screening. This [phone interview](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/interview-tips-recent-grads/) confirms your qualifications and your alignment with the Microsoft company values. It typically lasts about 15 minutes. 

The interviewer asks [behavioral interview questions](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/behavioral-interview-questions/) and quickly checks your technical knowledge. 

Be prepared to talk about yourself and sound enthusiastic when asked why you want to work at Microsoft. This interview checks whether you have done your homework on the company and researched them well.

During subsequent interviews, you may virtually meet the employees and managers of the team you're interviewing for. You will likely go through multiple interview rounds covering different topics related to your desired role. 

These technical interviews assess soft skills like problem-solving and position-specific hard skills like design, coding, and testing. They take place over Microsoft Teams and other third-party software.

The problem-solving portion lasts 45 minutes. Interviewers watch how you navigate issues and see how you think. 

Depending on your role, you may also complete tasks and answer questions in the following categories: 

* Design: Candidates are expected to understand how to design a new platform from scratch.
* Coding: You'll show your skills in whatever coding language you are most comfortable with. Be sure to practice as much as you can before the interview. Microsoft describes this portion as "a [critical part of the interview](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/virtual-interview)."
* Testing: You'll test your own code and code written by the other team members.
