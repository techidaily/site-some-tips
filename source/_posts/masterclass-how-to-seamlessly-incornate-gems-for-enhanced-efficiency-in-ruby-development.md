Custom AI assistants can help users customize [AI chatbots](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ai-chatbot/) for their specific needs without extensive coding or machine learning training skills. In May, Google unveiled its own version, [Gems](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-gemini-just-got-two-popular-chatgpt-plus-features-and-one-is-free-to-use/), and it's now available to all Gemini Advanced users.

Gemini Advanced is offered as part of the Google One AI Premium Plan, which costs users $20 monthly. However, there is a [one-month trial](https://www.zdnet.com/article/you-can-get-free-access-to-googles-new-ai-subscription-includes-access-to-gemini-advanced-and-the-rebranded-duet-ai-heres-how/) that users can participate in to try the plan and its perks, such as Gems, for free. Whether you are already a subscriber or just trying it out, you can benefit from learning to use Gems and incorporating them into your workflow.

Because navigating any new feature can be daunting, Google's Gem product lead, Deven Tokuno, [shared](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gems-tips/) some tips on how to get started and make the most of the Gem experience, which we summed up below. 

## 1\. Use premade Gems

Even though tailoring Gems might seem like the most valuable feature, starting with some premade Gems is a good way to get familiar with what Gems can do. Google already preloaded premade Gems into [Gemini](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-google-gemini/), which can be found on the left-hand panel of Gemini when subscribed to Gemini Advanced.

These premade Gems include a Brainstormer, Career guide, Coding partner, Learning coach, and Writing editor. You can use them to edit an essay, elaborate on ideas, fix code, and more. You can also use them as a soundboard for new custom Gems you'd like to create.

"You can make a copy of some of the basic premade Gems, where you can rewrite or add to the pre-filled instructions," said Tuoko. 

For example, you can customize the Brainstormer Gem with new instructions to better suit the project you are working on. 

## 2\. Make Gems that tackle repetitive tasks

As mentioned in the intro, one of the biggest advantages of custom AI assistants is that they allow you to avoid repeatedly entering the same instructions. As a result, customizing a Gem is especially useful in scenarios where you will be inputting the prompt to get assistance with the same task.

"One of our team members has this great use case about how they tend to write in a lot of run-on sentences," said Tokuno. "So they created a Gem to help simplify their writing and break up long sentences."

If you are stuck on how to customize your Gems to fit your task exactly, the next tip might come in handy. 

## 3\. Let Gemini help you with your Gem customization 

Creating or editing text is one of the best ways to use generative AI tools. Well, Google figured out how to leverage that capability to strengthen your Gem customization. 

Whether you're copying a premade Gem or creating one from scratch, you can click on the magic wand icon at the bottom of the text box to have Gemini rewrite and "expand" your instructions.

"Not only does it craft comprehensive instructions, but it also helps them learn how to write like a prompt engineer, showcasing what good instructions look like. It's a great way to get inspiration â€” and if you don't like it, you can undo it or edit it," said Tokuno. 

This helps remove the guesswork from creating a custom assistant and teaches you best practices for prompting, which is a handy skill when using an AI chatbot.

## 4\. Be specific 

Your custom AI assistant can only help you as much as you instruct it. Therefore, the more specific you are, the more tailored and useful the assistant will be. Google provides an example of using Gemini to role-play a conversation. 

 "Whether that's with a friend or a colleague, you might want to prep," said Tokuno. "And you can use a Gem to do a test run."

In those scenarios, you want to be as specific as possible about who Gems is role-playing to make your conversation as effective as possible. 

## 5\. Incorporate into your team 

Last but not least, Tuoko encourages users to think of Gems as their team, giving each a role that can help with every area of her life, professionally and personally. 

"Gems can be a tool that makes AI practical for each part of your life," said Tokuno. "I can even tell my Fridge forager Gem to act like a French sous chef to take it up a notch or my Reading buddy about my day to find a book that fits my mood."
