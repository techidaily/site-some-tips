Those who attended our #ABBYYDevCon event in 2023 [will recall the IDP Hackathon](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), which prompted contestants to design creative solutions that tackled modern document challenges using ABBYY Vantage. 

The event fostered an electric atmosphere of camaraderie and friendly competition that helped people leave the event with a feeling of fulfillment and inspiration. Not only did it fuel innovation and yield valuable information about our solutions – it also encouraged people to connect, collaborate, and build valuable relationships. ABBYY will provide bigger, more dynamic collaborations at future events.

The ABBYY AI Pulse [Developer Conference](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) introduces a new opportunity to showcase your innovation and tech skills.

Allow us to introduce [ABBYY Shark Tank](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). 

### Contest overview

Many are familiar with the general structure of the “Shark Tank” pitching contest: identify a problem, design a solution, and communicate its value and effectiveness to a panel of expert judges.

This is your opportunity to show off the transformative hypothetical business solution that you’ve been musing of to an audience of peers, colleagues and even ABBYY executives.

Here’s what we’re looking for:

* **Problem Statement:** Clearly articulate the problem you’re addressing.
* **Solution Value:** Explain the value that your solution brings to overcoming this challenge.
* **Demonstration:** Provide a compelling demonstration of your solution in action.
* **ABBYY Products Involved:** Highlight which ABBYY product(s) you’re utilizing in the solution and how they contribute to its effectiveness.

Interested? Read on for the rules.

### Rules and registration

* **Teams can have 1 to 4 members.** Teaming up? Swimming solo? No matter – just bring your A–game!
* **Teams are allotted 7 minutes to pitch** – Make every second count!
* **Teams may use a maximum of 2 slides** – Keep it sharp and impactful (you can prepare these in advance!)
* **Props are fair game** – get creative!
* **No interruptions or questions during the presentation** – Don’t worry, these sharks are patient.
* **3-minute Q&A after each presentation** – Be prepared to defend your pitch.

Each presentation should have a strong value proposition, convey a compelling message to “sell” the idea, and embrace a fun and competitive spirit. Stay tuned for more information on the grand prize. 

Any attendee from any region and any team can apply to participate, regardless of team size.
