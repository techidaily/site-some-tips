## Tactics for Transformative First Moments in Your Podcasts

"Create an intro to the podcast spicy enough to captivate the listener in a matter of seconds."

[A recent survey](https://training.npr.org/2017/03/27/how-to-hook-your-podcast-audience/) by accountant Nick Deprey shows that over 90 percent of listeners abandon a podcast only after 5 minutes. If information is not delivered in a way that piques the listener's attention and creates a picture in their mind, the human brain will typically lose interest. The podcast intro lasts for only about sixty seconds.

They say,

"The first impression is the last impression."

So, how can you utilize these sixty seconds to hook the audience to your podcast? It is through crafting a dramatic intro with a script that it is bound to leave an impression on the listener.

If you're new to podcasting or having difficulties attracting an audience, keep reading to get some scoop on how to compose an opening that will sweep the listener off his feet.

## Part 1\. What are podcasts intros?

A podcast intro is like a teaser that gives an insight into what the episode will be about. The introduction to the podcast usually appears at the start of the podcast.

Its duration varies from thirty to sixty seconds but acts as the determinant of the show's success. A good podcast intro is like a warrior that aids in scoring the audience, competing with thousands of other openings.

A well-designed intro usually starts with a hook grabbing the listener's undivided attention. So the listener would have no choice but to press the play button to find out more. So now, let's see some key elements of a podcast intro.

* **The podcast's name** is critical to give the listener a sense of what they will be listening to.
* **The episode title** is a one-word summation of the entire episode's content.
* **Host introduction**, introduce yourself and the co-hosts to the listener to develop familiarity.
* **Background music** draws the listener in and should be relevant to the introduction.
* **The tagline** is a major element that retains the listener's interest.
* **Sponsors**, if you have any, put their names in the introduction.
* **Disclaimer**, if your podcast contains any spoilers, it should be mentioned in the disclaimer.

Now that you know what a podcast intro is? Let's discuss why it matters!

## Part 2\. Why does the intro to podcasts matter?

Podcasts have gained massive popularity over the last decade. Currently, over 30 million podcasts are available, making it even harder for you to gain an audience if you are starting a new podcast.

The game is to entice the listener so that he would want more, and for that, we need an intro that is powerful enough to intrigue the audience. After establishing why we need a podcast intro, let's look at some sample intros from popular podcasts.

## Part 3\. What do podcast intros in trending podcasts sound like?

We will analyze the intros of the top three podcasts to find out the most important elements that make the introduction snappy enough to capture the audience.

_Table 1: shows the analysis of intros of the top 3 podcasts discussed above_

Now that we've established which elements are more prominent in the intros of some of the most popular podcasts. Let's review the essentials you should keep in mind when designing your introduction.

## Part 4\. How to make a good podcast intro?

If you want the audience to be unable to resist your podcast, design your podcast intro with the following tips in mind.

### How long should a podcast intro be?

Your podcast intro should be brief and snappy. The ideal duration for a podcast intro is between 30 to 60 seconds. However, it should not last more than a minute and a half.

The intro of "This American Life" lasted for sixty seconds, while the intro of stuff you should know was over in about forty seconds. Both of these intros were short and to the point. However, they did an excellent job of providing just the correct information to pique the audience's interest.

### Is background music helpful in making the intro more appealing?

Selecting a soundtrack or sound effects for your podcast intro is optional, but it enhances the quality of the content presented. The soundtrack should be chosen carefully as it functions as a logo that presents a brand.

A soundtrack can also give a classy feel to your intro and aid the listeners in vibing to your content. For instance, if you intend to present horror content in your podcast, spooky background music and sound effects can help the listener get into the mood. To avoid copyright issues, you can find free music at the YouTube audio library or Pixabay.

### Should you include a call to action in your intro and why?

Including a call to action at the start or the end of your intro can serve as a good marketing strategy for your social media account. Call-to-action phrases such as, "if you like our podcast, be sure to leave us a review," can also serve as a hook to capturing the listener's attention.

In the call to action, you can ask your listeners to do any of the following.

* Recommend your podcast to their friend circle.
* Visit your social media page and leave a review.
* To listen to the previous episodes.
* To buy your work, whether it's a book or a magazine.

A call to action is also effective in establishing familiarity with the listener. There is no right or wrong CTA, and you can select any given phrases that suit your podcast.

* If you enjoy our podcasts, don't forget to subscribe.
* Share our content with your friends and family; it'll help us create more content.
* If you like any changes in the format, do leave your suggestions in the comment box.

For instance, in the intro of "This American Life," Ira Glass uses the phrase, "If you haven't tried the previous episodes yet, you should." reminding the new audience to check the previous episodes as well.

### When is the right time to introduce yourself and your guests?

Logically it would help if you introduced yourself to the new audience right after introducing the name of your podcast. Introducing yourself is not challenging, but you can use guest introductions to create a buzz that will help you gain your listeners' attention.

The proper way to introduce your episode guest is to tell your audience about their background, how you know them, and why you invited them to your podcast. It will pique the listener's interest, and they will tune in to learn more. Now that you recognize what elements to pay attention to if you want to create a killer podcast intro.

Let's look at the samples of some of the most popular podcast intros.

## Part 5\. Effective podcast introduction examples

Once you've figured out how a good podcast intro should be, the last step would be to glance at the intros of the following popular podcasts to eliminate any further ambiguity.

**Our Analysis of the Intro**

As you can see, this intro is one of the most straightforward and fabulous in which the host first introduces the name of the podcast and then what the episode will be about and finally introduces the guest in the same manner as we talked about in the previous section.

This podcast's intro, which lasted for only 25 seconds, was backed by dramatic music that complimented it perfectly.

**Our Analysis of the Intro**

This podcast's intro is a bit of a freestyle that changes with each episode. It's also worth noting that the host introduced the podcast's sponsor, so it can also be a thing.

Are you surprised? There are so many untold stories about Chippendales that we didn't get to explore fully. So in this last episode, we are going to hear from some of the women who made Chippendale into this iconic brand that we know today, so to do that, I invited Nicole Hemmer and Neil J young to the show. "

**Our Analysis of the Intro**

It is a classic 2-minute intro that starts with a disclaimer and then the recap of the previous episode. Then, at last, the show host skillfully introduces the episode guests to the audience. This intro has subtle music in the back, which makes it upbeat.
