## Unveiling the Secrets of Using Multiple Screens on Netflix

Video and movie **streaming** has become a common amenity in modern life. Because of **apps**, watching a series or a movie can be done with only a few taps. You can now bake a cake or iron your clothes while watching something on **Netflix**. But did you know that you can also do this kind of multitasking on your device? Anything is possible with the Netflix **picture-in-picture** feature.

Android users have long enjoyed the use of a floating window on their devices. And now, this function is available for iOS users as well. The picture-in-picture function involves a floating window that can be resized and moved across the screen. You can comfortably text, mail, or browse the internet while comfortably watching a video on Netflix. Here is the ultimate guide to using the feature across different platforms.

1. Once the video is played, click the **media control button**. This can be found in the top right corner of the Chrome window.
1. Upon clicking it, a popup window will appear. Select the **"Picture in Picture" button**, positioned at the bottom right corner.
