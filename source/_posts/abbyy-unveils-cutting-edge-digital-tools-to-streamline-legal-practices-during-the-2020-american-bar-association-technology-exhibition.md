[ABBYY solutions](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) have been leveraged by leading law firms and legal entities around the globe to [handle the daily flow of civil lawsuits](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) and [transform legal document workflows](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). The products that will be showcased at the event include [FineReader 15](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), an AI-powered PDF solution that makes working with digital and paper documents in the workplace simple and efficient; [FineScanner AI](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a mobile application that works as an intelligent capture assistant powered by neural networks; and [FineReader Server](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a high-volume document conversion server.

“Our Digital Intelligence solutions enable legal professionals to easily digitize, edit, and enhance documents to streamline e-discovery, contract review, and other legal processes,” commented Kristin Wagener, Senior Director of Global Application Software Sales at ABBYY. “A recent [survey](https://www.aderant.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-Business-of-Law-Survey-Results.pdf "Survey") found that increasing operational efficiencies is the biggest challenge facing law firms today. Our suite of products provides legal professionals with tools to effectively manage document processes and increase efficiencies in legal workflows.”

The following solutions will be showcased and demonstrated at booth #503:

* **eDiscovery process support:** best-in-class image recognition technology mitigates the risk of missing important documents from the volume and variety of paper forms, handwritten notes, receipts, and images.
* **Automated batch processing** local, network, and email inbox folders can be configured to automatically batch-process incoming business documents.
* **Mobile scanning capabilities with custom voice commands:** ABBYY FineScanner AI allows users to scan documents on their mobile device and convert to PDF, JPEG or 10 other formats. The latest release includes built-in support for Siri Shortcuts and custom voice commands, enabling users to email files and open scans of important documents, such as contracts and case notes, without opening the app.
* **Searchable, editable PDF documents:**  ABBYY FineReader allows users to edit any PDF, even a scanned one, enabling teams to easily make changes, additions, and amendments to contracts, applications, and other legal documents.
