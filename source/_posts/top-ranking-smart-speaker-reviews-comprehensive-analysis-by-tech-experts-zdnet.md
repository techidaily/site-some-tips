## How did we choose these smart speakers?

When searching for the best smart speakers, I considered a number of factors.

* **Integrations:** The best smart speakers incorporate voice control, whether it is through Apple's Siri or Google Assistant.
* **Connectivity:** The best speakers offer a wireless connection via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
* **Size:** Not all speakers are easy for on-the-go listening. If you want something that is easily portable, consider a smart speaker of a smaller size that offers a wireless connection.
* **Budget:** We know that not everyone shares the same budget, so we look for smart speakers that suit a number of different pricepoints.

## What is a smart speaker and which brands make the most popular ones?

A smart speaker is a type of audio device that combines the functions of a speaker with a virtual assistant and voice control. The most popular brands that make smart speakers are Amazon, Google, Apple, and Sonos.

Amazon's popular smart speaker line is the Amazon Echo, which comes in a variety of sizes and styles, including the Echo Dot, Echo Show, and [Echo Studio](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/amazon-echo-studio-review-is-it-really-better-than-before/). These all have Alexa. Meanwhile, Google offers the Google Nest line of speakers with Google Assistant, and Apple's smart speaker range (HomePod) has Siri. Then there is Sonos, which offers premium sound in conjunction with support for popular voice assistants.

This guide tells you which of these smart speakers are worth buying, and what you'll get for your money.

## What can you do with a smart speaker?

A smart speaker works like a traditional speaker in that it plays audio content. But that is far from all it does. Smart speakers also feature integrations like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, and provide access to your favorite streaming apps. You can also use a smart speaker for voice control, phone calls, and even video messages, depending on the smart speaker you choose.

## Which smart speaker has free music?

The best smart speakers offer a wireless connection that allows you to connect to a number of programs. Stream from services like Pandora, Apple Music, and SiriusXM, with the cost all depending on which subscription you have.

## How much do the best smart speakers cost?
