If you do not fancy 3D texts and you want a simple but effective intro video, this can suit you perfectly. The text has a 2D texture and the animations are very basic. However, it manages to create an impact in the eyes of the beholders.

There are several dynamic geometric shapes available that enhance the animations and effects on the texts. The text performs twists and turns along with shakes with the beats. The background color is black and hence, the focus is on the text and its surrounding visible objects.
