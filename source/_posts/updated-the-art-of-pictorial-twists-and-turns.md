Some of the images you can distort using online tools include:

* Over-Exposition: This is when the person in the photo is too bright or overexposed to show the subject's features.
* Under-Exposure: This is when the person in the photo is too dark or under-exposed to show the subject's features.
* Visual Stretching is when you digitally stretch an image to the desired size, sometimes using a "zoom" feature to get closer or broader shots of the subject.

Playing with expressions can be enough to create funny photos.
