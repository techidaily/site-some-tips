## Flash Sale Alert: Secure One More Month of Surfshark VPN Services at No Extra Cost! Limited Time Only!

We take our digital security for granted until our information is compromised or stolen.

Surfshark VPN is one of the [top VPN options](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) for its protection features and its price. Normally, you can get the [24-month deal for $59.76, or just $2.21 per month](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fget.surfshark.net%2Faff%255Fc%3Foffer%255Fid%3D786%26aff%255Fid%3D1511), which includes two months free, but right now, you can get three months free, making it an even greater value for the money.

Along with these features, Surfshark lets you encrypt your internet activity so no one can track or steal your data, hide your location by changing your IP address, block ads and malware, keep internet searches private to prevent targeted ads, and more.
