##  The Other Stuff

 The first Copilot+ Windows laptops were [released earlier this week](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2024/06/18/top-things-to-know-about-copilot-pcs-from-microsoft-surface-available-today-at-microsoft-com/), with Qualcomm’s ARM-based Snapdragon X Elite chipsets instead of the usual AMD or Intel processors found in PC laptops. We’ll have to wait and see how well they work over time, but they more closely match the power efficiency of Apple’s MacBook lineup (which use ARM-based Apple Silicon chips).

 This has been a big week for Perplexity, a popular AI chatbot, but not in a good way. It was [accused of stealing articles by _Forbes_](https://www.axios.com/2024/06/18/forbes-perplexity-ai-legal-action-copyright), and [investigations by _Wired_ and _MacStories_](https://www.macstories.net/stories/wired-confirms-perplexity-is-bypassing-efforts-by-websites-to-block-its-web-crawler/) confirmed that the chatbot is still reading news articles from sites that have explicitly blocked it.

 Meanwhile, [Apple’s rules](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-samsung-galaxy-a34-5g-to-samsung-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/) about which emulators are allowed in the App Store are still not clear. The developer for iDOS just tried to publish its DOS emulator in the App Store, but [it was rejected](https://litchie.com/2024/04/new-hope) for not fitting the definition of “retro game console,” even though emulators for the similar Commodore 64 platform are already in the App Store.
