### Lightroom merges in HDR Raw format

However, while Photoshop HDR Pro is notable for HDR-centric editing and merging, Lightroom allows users to merge the RAW files in the software into HDR RAW files. So, photographers using **Lightroom HDR merge** can customize the images better and provide higher dynamic range quality with no formatting change. On the other hand, Photoshop allows Photoshop PSD file type merging mainly.

### Photoshop HDR Pro offers 8-bit/16-bit/32-bit file options

The Photoshop HDR Pro version allows 8-bit/16-bit files. You can change them to 32-bit files by tapping the top-right section of this software window. Here, you can use the setting “Complete Toning in Adobe Raw” instead of operating the standard HDR editor controls. You can also control the ghosting mode here.

### Photoshop vs. Lightroom Deghosting feature

On the other hand, features like **Lightroom bracketing** make it a suitable choice for photo editing. The HDR Merge Preview allows users to see the chosen images before any processing is started. The default settings for Deghost Amount, Auto Tone, and Auto Align are ticked, with the Deghost choice set as None.

After making any changes, you can tap the Merge button to complete the whole process. Lightroom automatically saves the image you merge in 32-bit .dng file format, adding a suffix-HDR to the file's name. You can edit the standard file in the Develop environment later.

So, in terms of 32-bit processing, both products are helpful, but customization options are more with Photoshop.

**Pros & Cons for Lightroom HDR**

Pros

* Automatically saves image files in 32.bit DNG format.
* Better learning curve compared to the Photoshop HDR Pro version.
* Easy load multiple bracketing images to do **Lightroom HDR merge** via the Library.

Cons

* Does not include 8 and 16-bit options as default.
* Blurry images are still possible after processing.

**Pros & Cons for Photoshop HDR Pro**

Pros

* No stand-alone software is necessary to use this feature.
* More personalization benefits with 32-fit file editing.
* You can use both editing and tone mapping functions separately and get realistic image looks.

Cons

* More artifacts that require extra cleaning can appear if there are many moving objects visible in one scene.
* Beginners will struggle with this solution since it is relatively complex.
