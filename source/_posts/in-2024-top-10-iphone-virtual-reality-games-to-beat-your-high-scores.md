With the development of 5G, the network speed will speed up significantly and the VR games will be more immersive and addictive on mobile devices as well. Though I’m not a traditional core player of VR games, I’ve done some researches and picked up some of the best iOS VR games that you will enjoy on the market currently. If you’ve a VR device for your iOS devices and look for some best VR gaming apps that you can play on iPhone or iPad, keep reading because in the rest of this article I will share more details and features about each VR games so you can choose the right one faster.

## 1. Zombie Shooter VR

This game showcases what it would be like to walk through a maze of subway tunnels in a post-apocalyptic future. The game pits players directly against ongoing hordes of zombies and mutants that can definitely up the scare factor as you are playing this title in VR. Explore the tunnels, arm yourself with various weapons and do what you can to find clues as you go through this app. The fun in this game comes from the wide range of environments in exploring the various titles. Overall the graphics could be better however.

## 2. InCell VR

Incell is a game where players can approach bioscience as a whole new game experience. Incell simulates what it would be like to be shrunk down into the human body. As you explore various human cells you can interact with the micro world and potentially fight off different infections and viruses. With a VR mode as well as a regular mode, Incell can be a fun experience that you can plan a wide range of Apple devices. The big advantages with this game is that it would be fun for anyone with an interest in biology. Exploring cells can be a wild ride. With less objective-based gameplay and a bit of a learning curve, it can take time to figure this title out however.

## 3. Lamper VR Firefly Rescue

Lamper is a game all about a firefly. If you love runner experiences like temple run, this is a VR title that you are going to really enjoy. With a full 3-D experience in many different colorful worlds, you can play as five different characters and guide them through huge obstacles. Control is quite precise and Mrs. known as one of the faster and more polished experiences in VR. The difficulty in this game ramps up quite quickly so it may take time before you feel confident in controlling the runner style gameplay.

## 4. End space VR

End space is a shooter that is built specifically for use with VR. Using the trigger buttons on the side of your VR headset you can fire weapons and have space battles by guiding your ship with hade based movements. 3-D positioned audio and top quality VR graphics ensure that this space shooter is action packed. Players can upgrade their ship as well as enjoy a never ending horde of harder ships to face off with them in space combat. There are plenty of upgrades for the ships and great sound with this game but with never ending style gameplay it does get old quite quickly.
