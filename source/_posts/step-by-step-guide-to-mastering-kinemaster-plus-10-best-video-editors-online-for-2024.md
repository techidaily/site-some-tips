## Step-by-Step Guide to Mastering KineMaster + 10 Best Video Editors Online

KineMaster is a powerful Android and iOS video editor that is used by YouTubers, Social Media Influencers, Video Editors, and so on.

However, sometimes you have to do advanced-level video editing, so you might be looking for the KineMaster web version.

Although there is no web version of this amazing tool, some workarounds can help you get **KineMaster Online** on your PC. Read on to find out more about it!

## How To Use KineMaster On Your PC

As aforementioned, KineMaster is only available for iOS and Android devices. However, if you want to use it on your PC, you can do it in the following way:

### Option 1: Use Android Emulator

An Android Emulator is a tool or program that helps you run Android apps on your computer, especially those not available for desktop.

You can use Bluestack or Android Studio emulator to run KineMaster on your Windows 7, 8, 10, or macOS.

Here's how you can download Bluestack and use it to install KineMaster on your PC:

Step1 Visit the official page of [Bluestack](https://www.bluestacks.com/), open the **Download** page, and click **“Download Bluestack.”**

Step2 Head to the **“Downloads”** folder on your PC, select the file and run the installer.

Step3 Now, follow the on-screen prompts to finish the installation process. Once **“Bluestack”** is installed, launch the program and search for KineMaster.

Step4 From the search result, click **“KineMaster,”** and select **“Install”** from the pop-up window. Wait for the process to complete, and you are done! You can now start using KineMaster on your PC to show your creative side in video editing.

### Option 2: Use The Chrome Extension ARC Welder

[ARC Welder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arc-welder/kpdfoacgfcaipjldndeamkboaeeeojpd) is a Chrome extension that lets you run mobile apps on your laptop/desktop. It's simple to use, and you don't need to fiddle with emulators or dual-booting to run KineMaster on your desktop or laptop.
