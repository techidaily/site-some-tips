Chief Marketing Officer, **ABBYY**

### Overview

Today’s information systems generate an unprecedented amount of data from both digital and physical sources. But how are organizations gaining value from that data? Digital Transformation is often oversimplified to most commonly refer to efforts being attempted with RPA technology. When we break down what our customers are trying to do, we find that 70% of all DX projects fail due to lack of visibility into end-to-end process improvement, and the idea of a one-size-fits-all automation approach is naïve. Customers really need best-of-breed solutions matched to the specific problems they are trying to solve.

Prof. Dr. ir. Wil van der Aalst has made it his life’s work to enable organizations to gain visibility into their business processes and empower them to make informed decisions to optimize them, based on objective and measurable criteria.

This webinar explores the evolution of process mining, from its development and refinement at Eindhoven University of Technology to mainstream adoption today, where it is embedded in commercial products and works alongside technologies such as RPA, Business Process Management (BPM) and Analytic Process Automation (APA). The combined power of these technologies enable organizations to fully understand and improve some of the most complex and variable business processes such as the patient journey, customer onboarding, claims processing, customer service, and more. With access to real-time data about exactly how processes are actually working and the content that fuels them, a human-centered workforce optimization and process automation solution empowers you to gain end-to-end visibility into processes where it matters most: customer experience, competitive advantage, and compliance.
