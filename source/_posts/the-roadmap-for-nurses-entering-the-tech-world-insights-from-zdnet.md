### 2\. Upskill

For most career changes, you'll need to expand your skillset. Fortunately, a nursing degree meets the educational requirement for many [information technology careers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/top-careers-in-information-technology/) as long as you also have the technical skills required. 

Consider [information technology certifications](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tech-certifications/) or [coding bootcamps](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-coding-bootcamps-guide/) to expand your skills. Online courses can also help you skill up. 

Some career paths, like computer scientist or data scientist, may require a graduate degree such as a [computer science master's](https://www.zdnet.com/education/computers-tech/best-online-computer-science-masters/). However, most tech companies hire candidates with a college degree and the skills listed in the job description.

### 3\. Maximize the quality of your application and portfolio.

Your application and portfolio need to make a positive first impression. So make sure to customize your application and highlight in-demand skills.

Most tech applications include a resume and cover letter. Your resume should list technical skills, people skills, and relevant nursing skills you'll bring to the role. Use examples that showcase your communication, leadership, and problem-solving abilities. 

The cover letter offers another opportunity to stand out. Customize the cover letter for each role, drawing on key phrases in the job posting. 

Many technical roles also require a portfolio that showcases your coding skills. Include projects that demonstrate your abilities and fit the job description. 

### 4\. Show your expertise, self-awareness, and passion throughout the interview process.

The interview process lets you showcase your expertise and passion. And your nursing background will help you stand out from other applicants.

Like nursing, many tech companies rely on recruiters and multiple-round interviews. Expect a phone screener at the beginning of the process, followed by a second interview that may include technical questions. 

Check out our [phone interview tips](https://www.zdnet.com/article/interview-tips-recent-grads/) and our resource on [computer science interview questions](https://www.zdnet.com/education/computer-science/common-computer-science-interview-questions/) to boost your interview skills.

## In conclusion

Switching fields can feel intimidating. By researching [how to switch careers to tech](https://www.zdnet.com/education/topic/how-to-switch-careers-to-tech/), you'll be able to choose the right career path, gain the necessary skills, and stand out during the interviews.
