## Related FAQs About Boomerang Maker

****Is there a limit on the Size of the Boomerang Video?**

Although you can technically create a boomerang video that is as long as you want, the length of the video you can make may be limited by the boomerang maker that you choose to use. You may also find that longer boomerang videos lose their effect after a while and therefore we recommend sticking to shorter looped videos that are much easier to share online, particularly on social media platforms.

Yes. Most solutions allow you to use an exciting video to create a boomerang video. But it is important to note that sometimes you may want to shoot a video that you can then use to create a boomerang video and therefore you should choose a tool that will allow you to do both. It is also worth pointing out that some tools are easier to use than others and you want to pick a solution that simplifies the process.
