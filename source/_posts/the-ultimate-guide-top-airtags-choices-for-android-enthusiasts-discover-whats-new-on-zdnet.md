### ZDNET's key takeaways

* The Chipolo One Point and Card point are available for [preorder starting at $28.](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-ONE-Point-Bluetooth-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB0C4W2VGTX%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C20a2310d-1d92-49c9-be68-6ebe47d4f9b6%7Cdtp&dtb=1)
* It's highly accurate, robust, and integrates well into the Google ecosystem.
* But it's only splashproof and the card version has a non-user-replaceable battery.

AirTags are one of those things that have set the Apple ecosystem apart from the Android ecosystem. But now that Google has rolled out its Find My Device network, the ecosystem for the Android platform is opening up.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Chipolo One Point The Chipolo One Point fob is the perfect finder to help you locate your keys, backpack, luggage using Google's Find My Device network. View at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-ONE-Point-Bluetooth-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB0C4W2VGTX%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C20a2310d-1d92-49c9-be68-6ebe47d4f9b6%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

And spearheading that is Slovenia-based tech company Chipolo, a company that's been in the finder tag market (the company uses the word "finder" rather than "tracker") for over a decade, and it has now released two tags exclusively for Android users â€“ the [One Point](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-ONE-Point-Bluetooth-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB0C4W2VGTX%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C20a2310d-1d92-49c9-be68-6ebe47d4f9b6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) fob for keys and the [Card Point](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fchipolo-card-point-item-finder-works-with-google-find-my-device-app-white%2F6551132.p&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) for wallets and bags. 

The One Point is a fob that fits on a keyring or anything else you can thing of attaching a fob to -- from your pet to your bike. It measures 1.49in/37.9mm and is 0.25in/6.4mm thin, and it is splashproof to IPX5 standard. 

Powering the tiny fob is a user-replaceable [CR2032 lithium coin cell](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProcter-Gamble-DURDL2032B4PK-Duracell-Lithium%2Fdp%2FB009108SGS%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C20a2310d-1d92-49c9-be68-6ebe47d4f9b6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) that should last about a year. 

User-replaceable battery gives the Chipolo One Point longevity.

As far as range, the fob is good to about 200ft/60m if you want to activate it to play a sound.

Chipolo Card Point

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

The Card Point is a thin plastic finder that measures 3.35 x 2.11in/85.1 x 53.6 mm and is only 0.09in/2.4mm thick -- about three times the thickness of a credit card. 

The Chipolo Card Point is super thin!

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Like the One Point, the Card Point is splashproof to IPX5 standard and has a sound activation range of 200ft/60m, but unlike the One Point fob, the Card Point doesn't have a user-replaceable battery. This may feel like a downside, but it's a necessary compromise to have a card that is this thin. 

**Also:** [**This rugged power bank is one of the fastest I've used - and it's so close to perfect**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/this-rugged-power-bank-is-one-of-the-fastest-ive-used-and-its-so-close-to-perfect/)

Also, as a sweetener, owners who register their finder with Chipolo after adding it to the Google Find My Device app will get an email with a 50% discount code for a new finder in two years, and users will be able to send the old finder back for recycling free of charge.

Everything about the Chipolo finders is easy, from the one-tap setup to the loud 105dB speaker that can be heard over the hustle and bustle of the world.

Setting up the Chipolo finders is easy -- squeeze the tag to get the process started!

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

I've tested the finding capability of these Chipolo finders and they are super accurate, with the ability to locate the tags when at a distance -- such as hidden in a plant pot on a street or when stuffed down the back of a couch.

They're like AirTags, but for Android users. 

However, there's only so much testing I can do, so in an effort to get better and longer testing, I've handed the tags to someone who has a habit of misplacing, well pretty much everything. This will give these tags hardcore real-world test, and if anything new is uncovered, I'll be sure to update this review.

## ZDNET's buying advice

If you're an Android user who has been jealous of iPhone users having AirTags, this is your chance to bring that feeling to an end!

The [Chipolo One Point](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-ONE-Point-Bluetooth-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB0C4W2VGTX%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C20a2310d-1d92-49c9-be68-6ebe47d4f9b6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is priced at $28 for a single tag, while the [Chipolo Card Point](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChipolo-ONE-Point-Bluetooth-Tracker%2Fdp%2FB0C4W2VGTX%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C20a2310d-1d92-49c9-be68-6ebe47d4f9b6%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is $35 for a single card.
