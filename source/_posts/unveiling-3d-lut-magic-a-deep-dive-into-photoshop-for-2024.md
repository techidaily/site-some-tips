Creating a filter to use is a satisfying activity. Now, the shortcoming arises when you want to use a filter in Photoshop and you have a limited amount of time. To do the trick here, you can import LUTs to your Photoshop and briskly incorporate it into your project in seconds - This calls a halt to the extremes of creating a filter.

Even though 3D LUT is mainly associated with video projects, it conversely works with photos in Photoshop. You don’t have to sweat it when incorporating 3D LUT in Photoshop since here is a complete guide to using 3D LUT in Photoshop.

#### In this article

01 [What is 3D LUT?](#part1)

02 [How to Import 3D LUT to Photoshop](#part2)

03 [How to Use 3D LUT in Photoshop](#part3)

## What is 3D LUT?

3D LUT (Look-Up-Table) is a function key that maps a given color space to another. Technically, LUTs are used for complex processes such as converting an image shot from a Canon Log profile and making it more enticing or converting one image color space to its better version.

Working with LUTs, there are two types; 3D LUT and 1D LUT. The difference is that the former provides room for complex color operations, whereas the latter has limitations on the number of color operations.

Here are more differences between 3D and 1D LUTs:

##### 3D LUT

It Places luma and color in a 3D (Cube) form; hence very easy to work with.

The output values are not from each respective combination in a color space.

It is a bit complex when customizing the basic settings such as contrast and white balance. Usually, the final result becomes remarkable.

##### 1D LUT

The color and luma are placed in a 1D; hence quite not easy to work on.

It contains a clear value of the outputs and on the basis of the bit depth, i.e., 1024 values in a 10 - bit.

It is a walk in the park when it comes to adjustments to the basic settings such as contrast, brightness, and white balance. But, the resulting output will be mid.

Wrapping up the differences, 3D LUTs are essential for colorists and editors since they can carry out tons of color customizations. Therefore, they can make their work uniquely stunning.

## How to Import 3D LUT to Photoshop

There are some 3D LUTs that Adobe Photoshop provides. Usually, these LUTs are limited and are not very effective when working on major projects. Most people, therefore, prefer to add their own 3D LUTs to Photoshop.

There are two ways to import 3D LUT to Photoshop; Adding LUTs to a specific project and Installing LUTs.

Before applying any of the two methods, you need to ensure you have your LUTs right there. You can purchase them or get them for free. Download them to your computer device.

#### Method 1\. Adding LUTs to a Particular Project

This first step is undemanding since you only have to locate a given LUT and then directly incorporate it into your project.

### Step 1\. Unzip your LUTs

First, you ought to unzip your files. In Mac devices, you double-click on the file to unzip it, whereas, in Windows, you right-click then select “Extract all” from the drop-down list.

### Step 2\. Create a Project

Go to the Photoshop app and create a new project. Load the image that you want to edit to Photoshop.

### Step 3\. Generate a new Adjustment Layer in Color Look Up

Go to the “Color Look Up” tab, then click on the “Adjustment” option.

## How to Use 3D LUT in Photoshop

Now that you have incorporated your 3D LUTs into the Photoshop folder, it is that time that you make use of it.

### Step 1\. Open your Project Image

First, go to your Photoshop app and add your photo.

### Step 2\. Open the Adjustment Panel

Hover over to “Color Lookup” and then select “Adjustments.”

In some instances, the Adjustment tab might be turned off. For this case, click on the windows option at the top of your interface, then select "Adjustment". Alternatively, you can access color look up adjustment by heading over to the Layers panel and clicking on “Adjustment.” From the drop-down menu, click on “Color Lookup.”

### Step 4\. Apply your 3D LUT

Here is our final step in 3D LUT Photoshop. After selecting “Load 3D LUT,” various LUTs will be displayed. Now, you need to select the LUT you added to the application.

Usually, the added LUTs are in .cube format, so select one that will work best with your project and apply it.
