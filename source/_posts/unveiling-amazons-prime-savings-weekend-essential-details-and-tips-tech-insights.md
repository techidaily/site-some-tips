## How much is an Amazon Prime membership?

Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month, or you can purchase an annual membership for $139, which will save you a few bucks. 

**Also:** [**These 5 new Amazon features make finding the products you need even easier**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-5-new-amazon-features-making-finding-the-product-you-need-even-easier/)

College students get a student discount of $7.49 per month or $69 per year. In addition, those with qualified government assistance can receive a Prime membership for just $6.99 after their free trial.

The membership includes free one-day delivery on most items, as well as access to Amazon Prime Video. 

## How often does Amazon do Prime deals?

Amazon is known for its annual Prime Day event, which happens in the summer in mid-July. However, last October was the first year the company did a second Prime event, dubbed October Prime Day.

This year's Prime Big Deal Days will be the second time Amazon has held two Prime sales events in one year, which we can assume means there will be two per year going forward. 

## How do I find Amazon Prime Big Deal Days deals?

Amazon usually has its deals broken down by category, as well as highlighting its lightening deals that only last a few hours on its homepage.

ZDNET will update our Amazon Prime Big Deal Days deals pages throughout the event so you can see the latest deals and snag the best savings.
