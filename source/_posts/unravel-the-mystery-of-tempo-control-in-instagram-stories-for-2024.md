## Unravel the Mystery of Tempo Control in Instagram Stories

You must keep posting interesting content regularly on Instagram to retain and grow followers. There is no alternative way to keep your followers updated and entertained than posting Instagram Stories. Instead of photos, short videos get the most traction on Instagram Stories. Most Instagram creators speed up or slow down videos on Instagram Stories to make them engaging and entertaining.

A sped-up video is mostly funny, while a slow-motion video is mostly gripping. Most Instagram creators prefer a professional video editor app for customizing the speed of the video.

But you might be wondering if you can change the speed of your video on Instagram Story directly through the Instagram app. We will answer how to speed up videos on Instagram Stories. We will illustrate how to change the speed of video through popular apps.

## Can I Change Video Speed on Instagram Stories?

No, you cannot directly change video speed on Instagram Story via the Instagram app. You can capture videos for Instagram Story through the app. You can use Superzoom to zoom in on an object with a dramatic background sound. You can even use Boomerang to take a photo and play it in a loop.
