## Let’s Give Them More of What They Want (AI)

###### by Chip VonBurg, Chief Customer Officer

In every industry and use case, our customers want more understanding of the differences between large language models, genAI, and small language models. They want to know how to get more insights from their data and how to get more value from their intelligent automation investment. 

More. More. More. Pressure for more revenue. Mandates to use more AI. Give customers a more delightful experience. Help employees do more. What more can be asked?

We’re already halfway through the year, and you may be hearing your leadership asking, “What more can you do to meet your KPIs?” Striving for more has been a strong theme among our customers this year. We’ve worked with them closely on strategic, revenue-generating and customer-facing initiatives. In every industry and use case, they want more understanding of the differences between large language models, genAI, and small language models. They want to know how to get more insights from their data, what could make their business processes run more streamlined, and how to get more value from their intelligent automation investment across all areas of the business. 

We have a “more” state of mind, too.

Giving more and caring more have always been core values at ABBYY, and it shows. In this edition of _The Intelligent Enterprise_, we share what customers had to say about how they got more out of their ABBYY AI investment. You’ll read about how a global sportswear company [changed their game](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) with a winning AI-enabled tech stack, be inspired by a number of ways that our customers are succeeding with [AI change management](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) while making their employees happier in the process, and hear what Rolls Royce, Emerson, and Société Générale shared about their intelligent automation journey at our recent [ABBYY AI Summit](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) at Emirates Stadium in London.
