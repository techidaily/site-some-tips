Pros 
* Extensive range of services
* Global infrastructure with low latency
* Flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing
* Strong security and compliance features

Cons 
* Steep learning curve for beginners
* Costs can escalate with heavy usage

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

#### Best cloud hosting service overall

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is our top pick for the best overall cloud hosting provider, and for good reason. AWS is the backbone for some of the world's largest companies. It offers everything from basic computing power to advanced machine learning tools. AWS is versatile enough to do pretty much anything any business needs.

AWS isn't just for large enterprises, though. It offers tools and services that meet the needs of both startups and SMBs, like storage solutions and the aforementioned computing power.

One of AWS's major green flags is its global infrastructure. Its data centers are spread across the globe. This means that if you're a global (or fledgling company with big aspirations), your applications are closer to your users, which translates to faster load times and a smoother user experience.

AWS also lets you easily scale resources up or down, without switching platforms. This scalability is coupled with a pay-as-you-go pricing model, so you only pay for the resources you actually use. This may not mean much to giant corporations, but is huge for small businesses looking to scale.

AWS can be a bit overwhelming though, especially if you're new to cloud hosting. While the platform offers extensive documentation and support, there's no denying that the learning curve is steep.

**Amazon Web Services key features:** : Scalable virtual servers | : Secure and durable object storage | : Managed relational database services | : Serverless computing | : Global content delivery network (CDN) | : Virtual Private Cloud for secure networking

Pros 
* Strong integration with Google services
* Excellent scalability
* Competitive pricing with sustained use discounts
* Advanced data analytics and AI tools

Cons 
* Complex for beginners
* Support options vary by plan

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

#### Best cloud hosting platform for scalability

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a top choice for businesses that need scalable cloud infrastructure. GCP is built to handle a wide range of workloads, so it's perfect for companies that have had or expect growth.

One major argument for GCP's scalability is its integration with powerful tools like Kubernetes Engine for container management and BigQuery for data analytics. These tools are built to scale and allow you to manage and analyze large amounts of data. 

Whether you're dealing with a sudden surge in traffic or you're expanding your operations, GCP can scale up (or down) without sacrificing responsiveness, reliability, and budget.

GCP's pricing model, with sustained use discounts, also supports scalability. This allows you to manage your business effectively as you grow instead of being tied to a specific tier level.

With all the good is a potential drawback: The platform's complexity can be a barrier for those new to cloud hosting, and support levels depend on the plan selected. They have a great [documentation portal](https://cloud.google.com/docs), though.

**Google Cloud Platform key features:** [**Compute Engine**](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute): Flexible virtual machines | [**Kubernetes Engine**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine): Managed container services | [**BigQuery**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery): Data analytics and warehousing | [**Vertex AI**](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en): Advanced machine learning tools | [**Cloud Storage**](https://cloud.google.com/storage?hl=en): Scalable and secure object storage

Pros 
* High-speed SSD storage
* Turbo servers for faster load times
* Reliable uptime
* Free site migration

Cons 
* Limited data centers compared to larger providers
* Higher renewal prices

### A2 Hosting

#### Best cloud hosting service for performance

If speed is what you're after, A2 Hosting is a solid choice. With its high-speed SSD storage and Turbo servers, A2 Hosting is built to deliver fast load times and reliable uptime, which is necessary if your website needs to handle heavy traffic or you just want everything to run smoothly.

The Turbo servers and SSD storage really do make a major difference in site speed (and if you're a content-heavy website, site speed = user experience = [green flag with Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience)). They make sure your site loads quickly and runs smoothly.

A2 Hosting also offers free site migration, which is a nice bonus if you're looking to switch from another provider without the hassle.

On the downside, A2 Hosting has fewer data centers compared to some larger providers, which might impact performance depending on where your visitors are located. Also, keep an eye on renewal rates, as they can be higher than the initial pricing.

**A2 Hosting key features:** [**Turbo Servers**](https://www.a2hosting.com/turbo-hosting/): Optimized for faster load times | [**SSD Storage**](https://www.a2hosting.com/nvme-hosting/): High-speed data access | [**Free Site Migration**](https://www.a2hosting.com/about/free-migration/): Easy transfer from other hosts | [**Uptime Guarantee**](https://www.a2hosting.com/99-9-uptime-commitment/): Reliable performance with minimal downtime | [**24/7 Support**](https://www.a2hosting.com/support/): Round-the-clock assistance

Pros 
* Transparent, low-cost pricing
* User-friendly interface
* Quick setup with pre-configured options
* Strong developer community

Cons 
* Limited advanced features
* Fewer global data centers

### DigitalOcean

#### Best budget cloud hosting service

DigitalOcean is our pick for the best budget cloud hosting service. I personally use DigitalOcean for my recently launched website in Japan and also for a site I run in the US. It's more than met my expectations for performance and, most importantly, budget.  
The platform's pre-configured droplets allow users to deploy virtual private servers in just a few minutes, which is particularly helpful for those with limited technical knowledge.

Even still, DigitalOcean does have a reputation for being a little difficult to get up and running, but with the extensive developer support and documentation, I had no troubles. This will vary between individuals, of course, but you can always contact support.

One of the biggest advantages of DigitalOcean is its transparent pricing. There are no hidden fees or complicated pricing tiers -- what you see is what you pay. This makes it an attractive option for those working with tight budgets who need to keep costs predictable.

**DigitalOcean key Features:** [**Droplets**](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets): Scalable virtual private servers | [**Managed Databases**](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases): Simplified database management | [**Kubernetes**](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes): Managed container orchestration | [**Spaces**](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces): Scalable object storage | [**Community Support**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community): Extensive tutorials and guides

[View now at Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/)

Pros 
* Extensive range of enterprise-grade tools
* Strong integration with Microsoft products
* Advanced security and compliance features
* Global network of data centers

Cons 
* Complex pricing structure
* Steeper learning curve for new users

### Microsoft Azure

#### Best cloud hosting service for enterprise

Microsoft Azure is our go-to pick for enterprises, especially if you're already using Microsoft products like Office 365 or Dynamics 365\. Azure's integration with these tools makes managing cloud resources smoother and keeps everything in sync with your existing workflows.

Azure really shines when it comes to handling complex workloads, thanks to its global network of data centers. This setup ensures your services are available and running smoothly, no matter where your users are.

However, the sheer range of features can be a bit much to wrap your head around if you're new to cloud services. And let's be honest -- the pricing can be a puzzle, with costs that vary depending on what you're using.

But if you're looking for a cloud platform that's reliable, secure, and deeply integrated with Microsoft's ecosystem, Azure is hard to beat.

**Microsoft Azure key features:** [**Virtual Machines**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/): Scalable computing power | [**Azure Active Directory**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/active-directory-b2c): Identity and access management | [**SQL Database**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-sql/database): Managed relational databases | [**Azure AI**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai): Advanced AI and machine learning tools | [**Global Network**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/global-network): Extensive network of data centers

[View now at Cloudways](https://www.cloudways.com/)

Pros 
* Managed hosting with high performance and security
* Choice of multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, etc.)
* Easy-to-use platform with one-click applications
* Pay-as-you-go pricing model

Cons 
* No domain registration service
* Limited control over underlying cloud infrastructure

### Cloudways

#### Best cloud hosting service for managed cloud hosting

Cloudways is a great option if you want the benefits of cloud hosting without the hassle of managing all the technical stuff. It's a managed cloud hosting platform that makes it easy to set up and run servers on major providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and DigitalOcean.

Cloudways is also super straightforward. The platform handles all the behind-the-scenes work -- like security, backups, and updates -- so you can focus on what really matters: your business. Plus, you get to choose from multiple cloud providers, and setting up popular apps like WordPress is as easy as clicking a button.

There are a couple of drawbacks, though. Cloudways doesn't offer domain registration, so you'll need to sort that out separately. Also, while you can tweak your server settings, you don't have direct access to the underlying cloud infrastructure, which might be a bummer if you need more control.

All in all, Cloudways is a solid choice if you're looking for a managed cloud hosting solution that's both powerful and easy to use.

**Cloudways key features:** [**Managed Hosting**](https://www.cloudways.com/en/managed-wordpress-hosting.php): Simplified cloud server management | [**Multiple Cloud Providers**](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/what-is-multi-cloud/): Choose from AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and others | [**One-Click Applications**](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/cloudways-launches-one-click-application-deployment-cloud-management/): Easy deployment of popular apps like WordPress | [**Pay-as-You-Go**](https://www.cloudways.com/en/pricing.php): Flexible pricing based on usage | [**Automated Backups**](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/hourly-backup-options-time-specific-restore-points/): Regular backups for data protection

### OVHCloud

#### Best cloud hosting service for customization

If you're looking for cloud hosting that lets you tweak just about everything, OVHCloud is a solid choice. It's our go-to pick for businesses that need a highly customizable hosting environment.

OVHCloud is all about flexibility. It offers a ton of options for configuring your servers, whether you're focused on performance, security, or meeting specific compliance requirements. This makes it a great fit for businesses that can't get what they need from more standard hosting setups.

OVHCloud is one of the largest providers in Europe, and it's fully on board with GDPR regulations. If privacy and security are top priorities for your business, OVHCloud has you covered. Plus, its pricing is pretty competitive, which is always a bonus. With a global network of data centers, you can also count on good performance and reliability.

That said, the user interface can be a bit tricky, and the level of support you get depends on the plan you choose. But if you need a hosting solution that you can really make your own, OVHCloud is worth checking out.

**OVHCloud key features:** [**Customizable Servers**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/bare-metal/): Tailor configurations to specific needs | [**Data Privacy**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/personal-data-protection/security/): Strong focus on compliance, particularly with GDPR | [**Global Network**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/about-us/global-infrastructure/): Extensive data center coverage for reliable performance | [**Flexible Pricing**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/public-cloud/prices/): Competitive plans that suit various budgets | [**Dedicated Resources**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/learn/what-is-dedicated-server/): Option to allocate resources specifically for your projects

## What is the best cloud hosting service?

AWS is our choice for the best cloud hosting service due to its extensive range of services and global network of data centers. AWS provides everything from basic computing and storage to advanced tools like AI and machine learning, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes and industries. For companies where reliable performance and uptime is a non-negotiable, its global infrastructure provides low latency and high availability.

One of AWS's key strengths is its flexible pricing model. With pay-as-you-go pricing, businesses can scale resources as needed, paying only for what they use. This makes AWS a cost-effective option for both startups and large enterprises.

While AWS leads the pack in our book, our other top picks are also strong contenders.

## Factors to consider when choosing a cloud hosting service

Choosing the right cloud hosting service is a big decision to make. Consider these factors first, and then decide which provider suits your needs best.

* **Reliability and uptime**: The reliability of your hosting provider isn't just important; it's necessary. Look for services with high uptime guarantees (99.9% or higher) to ensure your website or application remains accessible to users with minimal downtime. (Downtime = lost revenue!)
* **Pricing and scalability**: Understand the service's pricing structure, and be sure to include those pesky hidden costs. Consider whether the provider offers the ability to scale resources up or down as your needs change without incurring significant additional costs.
* **Security features**: You need to protect your (and your users') data, so make sure that the security features are top-shelf. Look for features like SSL certificates, firewalls, DDoS protection, and regular backups. Also, make sure the provider complies with relevant regulations, especially if you handle sensitive data, so that you don't get sued into oblivion.
* **Customer support**: Reliable customer support can be a lifesaver if you encounter issues. Check the availability of support (24/7 is ideal), the channels offered (live chat, phone, email), and the quality of the support based on user reviews.
* **Ease of use and management**: A user-friendly interface and straightforward management tools can save you time and reduce the overall complexity of running your site or application–especially if you don't have an in-house developer. Consider whether the provider offers a control panel or other management tools that make it easy to handle tasks like setting up domains, managing databases, and monitoring performance.
* **Additional tools and integrations**: What other tools does the hosting provider offer that could benefit you? How about content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, e-commerce platforms, and/or developer tools? Get the most bang for your buck.

## How we test cloud hosting services

When evaluating cloud hosting services, we focus on several key factors to ensure our recommendations are reliable and well-informed.

First, the hands-on testing. During my time working with several large, international IT companies in the US, Taiwan, and Japan, I have professional experience using six of the seven cloud hosting services in our list (DigitalOcean being the exclusion). My experience with DigitalOcean comes from running personal sites, including one in the US that previously saw over 500,000 visitors per month (until Google's controversial [Helpful Content Update](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update)) and another recently launched in Japan.

This experience allows me, to the best of my ability, to access the user experience, ease of setup, costs, performance metrics (i.e. uptime, load times, etc.) and overall functionality.

Then there's customer feedback. The problem with reviews is that you can't take one person's word for it. Gathering hundreds of review ratings and comments from actual users helps us assess the services from other perspectives and get closer to the "truth."

Then, of course, we compare features, pricing, and security, as these elements can vary over time and between providers.

Finally, we conduct additional research on each provider, including reviewing industry reports, expert opinions, and the company's overall reputation in the market.

By combining all of this (that is, the years of hands-on experience, feedback from real users, and other research), we're able to properly evaluate these cloud services and provide cloud hosting recommendations that are practical and trustworthy.

## Cloud hosting FAQs

## What is the difference between cloud hosting and traditional hosting?

**Cloud hosting** uses a network of virtual servers that draw resources from multiple physical servers. This setup allows for easy scaling since resources can be added or removed as needed. If one server fails, another takes over. This means better uptime and reliability.

**Traditional hosting** relies on a single server. In **shared hosting**, multiple websites share the same server resources, which can lead to slower performance. In **dedicated hosting**, your site has its own server. This gives you better performance but at a higher cost. Scaling usually requires upgrading to a different server or plan.

## Can you get cloud hosting for free?

Yes, you can get cloud hosting for free, but there are limitations. Some providers, like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, offer free tiers with limited resources, which are generally used for testing, small projects, or learning. These free options usually come with restrictions on storage, computing power, and support. You shouldn't use a free tier for a large or high-traffic site.

Many providers also offer free trial periods. These usually last 30 to 90 days, after which you'll need to switch to a paid plan to continue using the service.

In short, while free cloud hosting does exist and can be useful for small-scale needs, you'll likely need to eventually upgrade to a paid plan.

## Who is the largest cloud hosting provider?

The largest cloud hosting providers are AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. These three companies dominate the cloud hosting market.

## What is the best cloud hosting for small businesses?

For small businesses, DigitalOcean and A2 Hosting are excellent choices. DigitalOcean also offers affordable, easy-to-use cloud hosting with transparent pricing -- perfect for smaller businesses (including startups) who want to get online quickly without going bankrupt.

If you're a small business that needs a fast and dependable website to serve your customers, A2 Hosting is the way to go. 

All options offer the essential features small businesses need without unnecessary complexity or cost.
