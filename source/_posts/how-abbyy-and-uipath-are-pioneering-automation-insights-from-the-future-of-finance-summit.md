#### _ABBYY and partner will showcase capture-driven business process automation solutions for shared service providers_ 
  
ABBYY, a leading global provider of technologies and solutions to action information, will present capture-driven process automation solutions for BPOs and Shared Service Centers (SSC) at [the Future of Finance Summit](https://www.financetransformationeurope.com/ "The Future of Finance Summit, 2017") in London. This industry-leading event for CFOs, Finance Leaders and Global Process Owners addresses the most pressing topics in the industry and crafts a shared vision of the direction finance is taking. On the 15th and 16th of February, ABBYY’s experts, together with UiPath, a premium vendor of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software, will showcase innovative and trendsetting solutions for automating Accounts Payable processes.

“Today, it’s becoming very common for companies to outsource repetitive and work-intensive processes in order to reduce costs and free up staff. As a BPO or an SSC you must collect, classify and process large numbers of documents as invoices, purchase orders and forms in any format quickly and cost-effectively. ABBYY enables shared service providers to digitally process their customers’ AP related documents for instant use in the most effective way while addressing SLA, reporting and scalability needs,” says Neil Murphy, sales director at ABBYY UK.

ABBYY’s solutions for automated invoice processing help make service outsourcers more efficient and productive in processing invoices for their various customers. They automatically capture all incoming documents and process them promptly on one single platform. The data is then validated and transferred to the end customer’s ERP system for approval and payment. With this high level of automation, BPOs and SSCs can establish consistent and transparent business processes, ensure maximum data quality and make critical information available to the right person at the right time. The scalable platform architecture of ABBYY’s capture-driven solutions allows outsourcers to easily set up new customers and workflows. In addition, smart monitoring and reporting functionality enables transparent billing and validation of internal or external service level agreements.

“UiPath’s solution for AP optimisation streamlines complex P2P set-ups. Our RPA deployments and configurable workflow automation platform are the perfect fit with the high quality of data captured from invoices with ABBYY technology. This way, BPOs and SSCs can automate more than 80 per cent\* of the overall invoice operations and work even more cost-efficiently and accurately – a real competitive edge both to win and keep customers,” explains Guy Kirkwood, COO of UiPath.

\*_Automation rate is variable and dependent on overall environment, quality of input and PO matching availability_
