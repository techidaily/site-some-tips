## Unlock Access to Free AI Image Learning: Masterful Techniques on Udemy Revealed by ZDNet

Over the past few months, I've been diving into AI courses that are free for anyone to take. Thanks to the absolute explosion of [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/), there are a lot of courses out there. 

Recently, I spotlighted courses from IBM, Amazon, and OpenAI and DeepLearning. Here are those articles: 

* **[Have 10 hours? IBM will train you in AI fundamentals - for free](https://www.zdnet.com/article/have-10-hours-ibm-will-train-you-in-ai-fundamentals-for-free/)**
* **[I took OpenAI's free AI course for developers in one weekend](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-took-this-free-ai-course-for-developers-in-one-weekend-and-highly-recommend-it/)**
* **[I spent a fascinating weekend with Amazon's free AI courses](https://www.zdnet.com/article/unlock-ai-secrets-transform-your-skills-with-amazons-free-ai-learning/)**

In this article, I'm expanding outside of the vendor-provided courses. As you might imagine, the vendor-provided courses all have a bit of their own marketing spin in them. Don't get me wrong. They're excellent courses. But this time, we're moving to courses made by third parties and hosted on [Udemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=39197&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2F). 

I'm doing two Udemy articles. This one will focus more on generative AI graphics, although some courses are a mix of text and graphics. The next one will be all about text-based generative AI. 

##  What is Udemy? 

Udemy is an online learning platform that hosts courses created by individual trainers. Trainers don't have to jump through too many hoops to get on the platform, but they are subject to student ratings. Of course, effective trainers will attract more students and higher ratings. 

**Also: [The best AI image generators to try right now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ai-image-generator/)**

Udemy sells courses individually, a la carte. It also sells a [$20/month plan](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=39197&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fpersonal-plan%2F), where you can consume as many courses as you want during the months you pay. Think of this as an educational Netflix plan.

##  So what's the free trick? 

As mentioned in the title of this article, you can take these AI classes for free. The "trick" is that Udemy offers [a 30-day free trial period](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=39197&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fpersonal-plan%2F), after which you will be charged. But most of the courses are fairly short. 

One I checked out was a total of six hours over a bunch of modules. The biggest I've seen is all of 15 hours of content. If you really want to do some learning about AI and you want to do it for free, anyone who's serious should be able to churn through a bunch of these classes within a month's time. 

If you decide to stay on for a Udemy membership after your trial period is over, $20/month isn't all that bad a fee to pay for the number of courses Udemy offers, including those well beyond AI.
