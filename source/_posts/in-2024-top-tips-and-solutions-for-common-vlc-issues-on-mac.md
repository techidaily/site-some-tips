## 3. What is the best VLC version to download on Mac?

All MacOS system users need to pay attention here. Many people complain that the version of VLC that they downloaded off the internet is not functioning properly on their Mac. There is a reason behind its bleak performance.

The latest version of VLC media player is supported on the Mac OS X version. If you have this version then make sure to download the latest release. If not, do not despair because there is something for you too.

VLC offers something for everyone; if you have an older version of the macOS system, you will need previous releases of the VLC media player. But which one?

TIPS
