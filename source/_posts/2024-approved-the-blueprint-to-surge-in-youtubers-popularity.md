Adding relevant terms to your tittles and video description will help your content climb search result fast. Don't make the tittle too long and make your title be descriptive as to give your audience a sneak peek as to what the video all about.

Thumbnail help you attract new users to your channel and if you are not designing catchy thumbnail you are missing out a lot.
