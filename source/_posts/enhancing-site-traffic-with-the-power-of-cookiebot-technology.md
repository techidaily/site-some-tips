#### _Acquisition Expands ABBYY’s Digital IQ Capabilities by Combining Content and Process IQ_

ABBYY, a global leader in Content IQ technologies and solutions, today announced the intent to acquire Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based [TimelinePI](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). TimelinePI provides a comprehensive process intelligence platform designed to empower users to understand, monitor and optimize any business process.

The global process analytics market size is expected to grow to USD 1,421.7 million by 2023 according to [Research and Markets](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/qfxh3f/global%5Fprocess?w=4 "Research and Markets"). The acquisition of TimelinePI is intended as a strategic investment by ABBYY into the emerging process intelligence market, which is critical to truly understand the impact and effectiveness of business processes and opportunities for productivity gains from digital transformation investments. TimelinePI’s vision of combining the most versatile process mining and operational monitoring with cutting-edge, process-centric AI and machine learning will serve as a critical cornerstone to ABBYY’s Digital IQ strategy.

“Organizations are focused on digital intelligence to impact process, patient, business and customer outcomes. Process intelligence is required to truly understand the operational effectiveness of business processes and how well they support a business strategy,” commented Ulf Persson, CEO at ABBYY. “With TimelinePI, ABBYY will have the most comprehensive process intelligence platform for empowering companies to go beyond traditional text analytics and process mining to achieve true digital intelligence. With ABBYY’s advanced content analysis and natural language processing, the TimelinePI technology will achieve operational insights not available with traditional process mining tools.”

TimelinePI’s platform enables anyone to visualize, quantify and understand how processes behave by providing detailed insights into true performance, bottlenecks and risks. Its patent-pending Timeline Analysis approach is unique in its ability to handle the full range of business process types – from highly structured to ad hoc. This new approach to process intelligence allows healthcare providers, banks, insurance companies, government agencies and other customers to take control of their data and raise their Process IQ to achieve operational efficiency that improves the customer journey.

“Critical factors driving the success or failure of digital transformation projects include having a detailed understanding of an organization’s business processes,” said Scott Opitz, president and CEO of TimelinePI. “By gaining ABBYY’s deep understanding of content we are able to open a treasure trove of data to strengthen our offering and give companies the edge they need to operate more efficiently. We are excited to be joining ABBYY, combining our process mining, monitoring and predictive analytics capabilities with ABBYY’s rich Content IQ portfolio to enable our customers to achieve true process intelligence.”

Upon the completion of the transaction, ABBYY will continue to market and enhance the TimelinePI platform and offering to customers both separately and as part of new solution bundles as an extension of ABBYY’s current and future products.
