 From the end of an era for SSDs to the rise of Google Pixel as a mainstream smartphone, there was no shortage of news and trends to follow in 2023\. In this article, we will recap the top 10 stories of 2023, as decided by your viewership. Make sure you didn't miss a thing.

##  1\. [Western Digital Won't Make SSDs Anymore](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-mac-visual-seize-methods-reviewed-limit-156-chars/) 

> Western Digital is one of the big manufacturers for hard disks, but the company also makes more modern SSDs as well, partially thanks to its purchase of SanDisk in 2016\. However, Western Digital is now set to split into two companies, which could mean changes to some of its products. By [Arol Wright](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-snapchat-location-spoofer-to-protect-your-privacy-on-xiaomi-redmi-k70-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) 

 One of the biggest stories of the year, according to you, was Western Digital's decision to split its hard drive and flash memory businesses into two independent companies. The result was SanDisk essentially becoming its own SSD company again and the WD name being reserved for spinning hard drives only.

##  2\. [How to Disable YouTube Shorts](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-your-messages-after-civi-3-disney-100th-anniversary-edition-has-been-deleted-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/) 

> Not a big fan of YouTube's short-form videos in your feed and want to get rid of them? While there's no official method to turn off YouTube Shorts, you have a few workarounds to hide them from appearing in your feed. We'll show you how to do that on your iPhone, Android phone, and desktop computer. By [Mahesh Makwava](https://location-social.techidaily.com/4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-asus-rog-phone-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) 

 Well, apparently, people do _not_ like YouTube Shorts. Google's attempt to compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels has been a nuisance to a lot of long-time YouTube users. The good news is you can get rid of it in some places, but not as much as you might like.

##  3\. [Google Pixel Is No Longer an "Enthusiast" Phone, Thanks to Skyrocketing Sales](https://video-capture.techidaily.com/step-by-step-techniques-for-high-quality-lenovo-captures-for-2024/) 

> Historically speaking, Google's smartphones have never been all that popular. They enjoy plenty of critical acclaim, but they hardly make a dent in the larger smartphone market. Now, the tides are beginning to change. Google Pixel is currently the number three Android brand in North America. By [Andrew Heinzman](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-sound-excellence-for-podcasters-ultimate-audio-interface-guide/) 

 2023 was the year the Google Pixel line became a more serious smartphone contender. However, it's still far behind. Third place in North America amounts to a measly 2.46% of the market, and that's only among Android vendors. However, it became the top Android brand in Japan.

##  4\. [10 Inexpensive Ways to Breathe New Life Into an Old PC](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/exclusive-win-audio-experience-for-2024/) 

> Why buy a new computer when the one you have just needs a little spring cleaning and some inexpensive upgrades to give you many more years of service? Here are some easy tips and tricks to rejuvenate your old PC. By [Jason Fitzpatrick](https://network-issues.techidaily.com/silencing-shimmer-on-windows-monitors/) 

 If there's one thing that people consistently love to read, it's ways to make old gadgets work better. This is especially useful as the price of electronics has gone through the roof. Why upgrade to something new when you still have a functional computer?

##  5\. [10 Google Messages Features You Should Be Using](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/revealing-the-smarts-of-z2-play-mobile-for-2024/) 

> Texting is one of the most basic functions of a smartphone, but that doesn't mean it has to be boring. Google's "Messages" app is default on many Android devices, and it has quite a few nifty features to enhance the text messaging experience. By [Joe Fedewa](https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tune-up-your-social-media-videos-for-maximum-impact/) 

 This type of article is almost always well-received because it shows off the cool features of an app you're probably already using. Google Messages is not just a barebones stock app—Google has infused it with a lot of truly handy features—making it one of the best messaging apps on the platform.

##  6\. [Amazon Fire TV Has a New Home for Free Streaming](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-economic-expressiveness-in-video-theming-tools/) 

> Amazon's Fire TV experience isn't perfect, and one of the more annoying aspects has been how Amazon organizes its free content. The company has experimented with free live and on-demand content, but there wasn't one central location for everything. That's now changing with the launch of Fire TV Channels. By [Arol Wright](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-snapchat-location-spoofer-to-protect-your-privacy-on-xiaomi-redmi-k70-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) 

 Free stuff is always popular, and for good reason. It's tiring to see price tags on everything you might want to watch on your smart TV. This year, Amazon launched "Fire TV Channels" as a central hub for all of the free content you can enjoy on your Fire TV device.

##  7\. [How to Get an OpenAI API Key](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-xs-without-passcode-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/) 

> Lots of applications and AI tools now require you bring your own OpenAI API key. You can generate one on OpenAI's website, and it comes with $5 of free credit. Here's how to get started with OpenAI's API to get ChatGPT-style AI features outside of the standard ChatGPT interface. By [Reyadh Rahman](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-instantaneous-imagery-a-step-by-step-for-quick-google-collage-photos/) 

 Did you think AI was going to fade away in 2023? Well, it didn't, and it doesn't appear to be doing so any time soon. Open AI API keys are required in various applications if you want to unlock AI features, which is apparently something a lot of people are doing.

##  8\. [You Can Browse Facebook Marketplace Without an Account](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/in-2024-charting-the-path-to-previous-imagery-a-facebook-centric-guide/) 

> For better or worse, Facebook Marketplace has become the primary destination for buying and selling used stuff online. However, you may not want to sign into Facebook to browse listings. You actually don't have to—if you know where to look. By [Joe Fedewa](https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tune-up-your-social-media-videos-for-maximum-impact/) 

 At some point in the last five years or so, much of the buying and selling used items online converged to Facebook Marketplace. But not everyone has a Facebook account—which may be more true in 2023 than any other recent year. The good news is you can still browse.

##  9\. [How to Create 3D Cinematic Photos With Google Photos](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-motorola-moto-g34-5g-by-drfone-android/) 

> Smartphone cameras don't just take static photos anymore−there are "Live Photos" and "Motion Photos" that create tiny videos for the moment. Google Photos for Android and iPhone can go a step further and even add motion to existing static images. By [Joe Fedewa](https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tune-up-your-social-media-videos-for-maximum-impact/) 

 Google Photos might be the best app for doing just plain cool stuff with your photos. "Cinematic Photos" was introduced in 2023, [along with animated GIFs](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ace-the-art-of-youtube-reactions-3-innovative-approaches-unveiled/). It's a simple and fun trick to add some depth and motion to any photo.

##  10\. [5 Best Evernote Alternatives](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-paving-a-path-to-prominence-instagrams-power-brokers-in-your-sphere/) 

> Evernote is a tried and tested note-taking app, but it's not without its problems. If you're sick of the restrictive free plan and slow native apps, here are some good alternatives you can try. By [Tim Brookes](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-iphone-13-pro-max-blacklist-removal-tips-and-tools-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) 

 Evernote has been around for a very, very long time, and it hasn't aged as well as some other note-taking apps. To make matters worse, the app's free plan doesn't allow you to do very much anymore. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain.
