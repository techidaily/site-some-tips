### 4\. Remove Red Eyes

Red-eyed pictures occur when you capture the image in a night vision or dim light. So due to the lack of required light, the eyes of the subject in your picture appear to be red which may ruin the image. Pixlr free photo editor is capable of removing red-eye from the image with a single click.

### 5\. Add Double Exposure

This technique is usually applied to merge two layers and exposures on a single image. You will browse an image from the gallery and can combine it with the existing image on the editor to make double exposure. People use this technique to display an artistic element by merging two photos at once. It also helps to convey deep meanings with symbolism and double exposures.

Through this distinct feature of Pixlr editor, apart from combing two photos at once, you can also apply subtle effects to make the photo surreal and creative.

### 6\. Splash the Colors

Mixing and playing with the colors is another way to express the innovative imagination. Pixlr free photo editor provides this opportunity to the people who would like to intermix the colors in their photos. On this feature, you can use the option of "Tolerance" to colorize the specific part of the image. Also, through "Tint," you can manage the color ranges. You can also colorize the whole picture with both of these options to display your creativeness. Sounds great!

### 7\. Add Doodles

### 8\. Explore Borders and Stickers

What makes images exciting and inviting? Borders and funny stickers can help to enhance your images effortlessly. On Pixlr, there is a wide variety of borders that can instantly change the look of your dull photo. For instance, for a filmy and dramatic look, you can apply filters like dirt, cornered, film, etc. Whereas for a soft touch, you can add borders like clean, black, flowery, and ground. You can also tilt or set the frame of the borders according to your will.

When it comes to stickers, you can apply funny, sad, or angry stickers to express the emotion from a picture. You can easily embed the sticker on your images and share it with your social media platforms as a meme, message, or story. It is undoubtedly good for you!

### 9\. Add Effects and Overlays

If you find your image still boring even after adding all the elements, borders, stickers, and drawings, you can apply high-quality effects and overlays to the images within no time. Effects act like filters that can change the color range of your picture, and each effect has a unique quality. The effects offered in this tool are atomic, creative, unicolor, vintage, and too old.

On the other hand, people like to use the feature of overlays to add extra layers and texture to their images for enhancement. Pixlr photo editor offers diverse effects and provides high-quality overlays that you can apply to the picture. Using these options, anyone can convert dull pictures into vibrant and lively ones.

### 10\. Heal and Smooth the Image

Another unique feature of Pixlr photo editor is healing and smooth brushes that can eradicate the irregularities and imperfections on your picture naturally. Through a healing tool, you can remove the flaws by pointing out the spots to be precise and accurate. You can also use options of shade and shine that work as natural filters that results in a perfect picture.

On the other hand, a smooth tool can work like magic by upgrading the resolution of the picture. If your picture has distorted pixels, this specific tool will smooth the imperfections as much as possible.
