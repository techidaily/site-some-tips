## Elevating Python Skills Through LinkedIn's Gratis AI Course: An Empowering Experience | ZDNET

By now, almost everyone knows about [generative AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/)'s impact on the tech industry. And that's not all hype: GenAI has produced genuine benefits and productivity gains. But while logging into [ChatGPT Plus](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-subscribe-to-chatgpt-plus-and-why/) and [asking DALL-E 3 to generate a portrait of every state](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-asked-dall-e-3-to-create-a-portrait-of-every-us-state-and-the-results-were-gloriously-strange/) is pretty easy, if a bit tedious, there's a great deal more you can do with [AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/) \-- if you know how.

**Also: [ChatGPT can now read its responses aloud - how to listen to them](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-can-now-read-its-responses-aloud-heres-how-to-listen-to-them/)**

And that's where learning resources come in. Over the past few months, I've been spotlighting courseware offerings that are both free and good. Sure, a ton of folks are trying to take your money in return for training ranging from mediocre to great. But rather than encouraging you to pay out your hard-earned Benjamins, I've been spotlighting a bunch of really excellent _free_ courseware offerings.

LinkedIn Learning is one of the original online courseware providers. Started almost 30 years ago by Lynda Weinman, the site was known as [Lynda.com](http://Lynda.com) until it was acquired by LinkedIn in 2015\. I've been a subscriber to the service since the early days, and now I get my subscription as an alumnus of my grad school. LinkedIn Learning's courses are almost all solid and its teachers are clear and friendly. 

**Also: [The best AI image generators: Tested and reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ai-image-generator/)**

Normally, [the service costs $39/mo](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) if you sign up to pay month-by-month, and $19.95/month if you prepay for a year. There are also team plans. However, as of today, [LinkedIn is unlocking 250 AI courses for a month, so everyone can learn for free](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/250-free-ai-courses). 

##  How this differs from LinkedIn's normal free trial 

This special 30-day program differs from LinkedIn's 30-day free trial in several important ways: 

* You don't need to register with LinkedIn.
* You don't need a credit card.
* If you already used up your free LinkedIn Learning trial time, you can still take these courses, and you can sign up for a free LinkedIn Learning trial after taking these courses, as a separate 30-day period.

I have to give a big shout-out to LinkedIn for this offering. Normally, companies offer free loss-leaders to users as a way to gather a mailing list for later promotion. LinkedIn isn't doing that. If you want to remain completely anonymous, not give up any of your personal details, and not get sold to later down the line, you can! 

**Also: [How to add a new credential to your LinkedIn profile](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/how-to-add-a-new-credential-to-your-linkedin-profile-and-why-you-should/)**

That turns this from what I originally thought was just another marketing scheme into full-on good work. It's up to you to cram as many courses as you can into the next 30 days, but if you can give up enough sleep, you can learn a lot for free.

##  The classes I took 

In this article, I've spotlighted 14 of the courses I think are most interesting. My favorite (although I'm partial because the author is a colleague) has to be the [ChatGPT Tips for the Help Desk](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/chatgpt-tips-for-the-help-desk/welcome) by Pam Baker. A seasoned technology journalist, Pam is also the author of [ChatGPT for Dummies](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FChatGPT-Dummies-Computer-tech%2Fdp%2F1394204639%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb382313c-a92c-41ea-9b35-b1ada13c7d1b%7Cdtp&dtb=1). She knows her stuff. 

I took the full course. In about an hour and a half, she covers not only why a chatbot is ideally suited for a help desk, but also how to use APIs to integrate the two technologies. She goes into an important deep dive about how to prevent hallucinations, which is critical if you want to deploy self-service help solutions to customers. And she explores a wide number of help desk scenarios, including the pros and cons of human help desk agents using ChatGPT in real-time. 

**Also: [What is an AI PC? (And should you buy one?)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-an-ai-pc-and-should-you-buy-one/)**

I also took the two-hour [Machine Learning with Python: Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/machine-learning-with-python-foundations/machine-learning-in-our-world-23459526) course, which had a great instructor -- Prof. Frederick Nwanganga -- who was previously unknown to me. I have to hand it to LinkedIn. They choose people who know how to teach.

I learned a lot in this course, especially about how to collect and prepare data for machine learning. I also was able to stretch my Python programming knowledge, specifically about how a machine learning model can be built in Python. In just two hours, I felt like I got a friendly and comprehensive brain dump. 

There are many other helpful courses. Let's break them down into categories and look at some examples. 

##  General AI literacy 

These two are courses that any professional can take to improve understanding of AI overall.

##  AI courses for Python coders 

Python is one of the most popular languages among AI developers. Here I look at four courses that can help you integrate your Python knowledge with AI. [According to Ya Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engineerings-new-world-work-look-todays-most-in-demand-ya-xu-1mmee/), VP of engineering and head of data and AI at LinkedIn, "Skills in key programming languages commonly used in the development of AI – Python, Java, and SQL – rank among the top five most sought-after skills on the technical side in the US."
