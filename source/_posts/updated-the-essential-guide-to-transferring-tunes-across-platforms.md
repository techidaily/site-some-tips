## The Essential Guide to Transferring Tunes Across Platforms

Are you thinking of switching your music platform, but at the same time, you fear losing your playlist? A manual transfer may take days, and every service only supports some tracks. So, 100 percent recreation is just a dream.

However, thanks to playlist transfer tools compatible with computers and mobile devices. You can effortlessly transfer your favorite podcast and music before you delete your audio streaming platform.

This article will discuss transferring playlists between music services using different online tools and apps. So, let's get right to it!

## Tools To Transfer Playlist Between Music Services

Don't want to spend hours searching and shifting your playlist from one music service to other? The good news is that you can transfer playlists with third-party tools in a matter of moments.

However, the transfer time depends on your service, internet connection speed, and library size. So, let's look at how different tools help you with seamless music transfer.

### 1\. TuneMyMusic
