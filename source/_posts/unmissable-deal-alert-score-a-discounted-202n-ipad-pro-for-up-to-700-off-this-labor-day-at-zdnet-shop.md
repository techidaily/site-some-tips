And, you can snag deals on brands that rarely ever go on sale, like Apple. Right now, Apple's 6th-generation [12.9-inch iPad Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-latest-model-with-wi-fi-cellular-1tb-space-gray-unlocked%2F5202400.p%3FskuId%3D5202400&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) with 1TB of storage and Wi-Fi + Cellular is $1,299 instead of its original price of $1,999\. 

[Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) for $1,299 (save $700) View now at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-latest-model-with-wi-fi-cellular-1tb-space-gray-unlocked%2F5202400.p%3FskuId%3D5202400&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1)

Even though this iPad Pro isn't the latest model, it's still a powerhouse tablet thanks to Apple's M2 processor. The iPad Pro is also Apple's largest tablet, with a 12.9-inch superior display for lifelike images and graphics. 

ZDNET editor-in-chief, Jason Hiner, said that this iPad "pushes the boundaries of what's possible for a tablet." "For professionals who want the flexibility of drawing with a digital device or working with AR for viewing and capturing high-quality video without a heavy, bulky rig, the iPad Pro is a purpose-built device that works great," Hiner wrote in his roundup.

Plus, it supports the 2nd-generation Apple Pencil, as well as the handy hover feature that works when the tip of the Apple Pencil gets within 12 millimeters of the display, making parts of the interface come to life in supported apps.
