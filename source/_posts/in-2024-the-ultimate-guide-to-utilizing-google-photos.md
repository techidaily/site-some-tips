## The Ultimate Guide to Utilizing Google Photos

Since its inception some years ago, Google Images has established itself as a go-to service for many consumers who want to keep their photos and videos online. The Google Photos service allows you to store personal images in a virtual vault and makes that data accessible from any device you own.

Also included are various tools for organizing, viewing, altering, and finding your digital memories via the use of the service. Because it is the default picture app for Google's Android operating system, it is available on most Android phones linked to your Google Account.

This comprehensive **Google** **Video** **Editor** tutorial has been compiled to assist you with your Google Photos navigation. Make sure you know everything about Google Video Editor before using it the next time! Let's get this ball rolling!

04 [How to Create Videos With Google Photos?](#part4)

05 [How to Share Edited Videos from Google Photos?](#part5)

## Part 1: What is Google Photos?

Google Photos is a platform for uploading, sharing, and storing digital photos. A year after its debut, it's already a global phenomenon. And Google Photographs uses the term "the cloud" to refer to the online storage of your photos and videos.

If you had to do this in the past, you would have had to connect your phone or camera to a computer to upload your photographs and movies. You may have then backed up your PC to an external hard drive. But now, with Google Photos, the process is effortless and does not require a USB connection.

In addition to the benefits listed above, keeping your photographs and movies in the cloud has the following aspects:

* It has many options for organizing, using, sharing, and managing your photographs and videos.
* It's compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
* Anyone can use Google Photos, regardless of their level of computer literacy. It's easy to figure out where you are and how to go about.
* The days of running out of space on your phone are long gone. You'll be able to free up some space on your phone once you've uploaded your pictures and movies.
* As long as you have an internet connection, you may view your photographs and videos from any device (phone, tablet, computer).
* To share an album of images or videos with a friend or family member is easy.
* Whenever you're connected to Wi-Fi, you may schedule automatic backups to take place.
* Storage space is provided at no cost to you. If you want your images to be preserved at their original resolution, you can pay, but you'll probably be happy with the free version's typical excellent quality. Compression is applied to images and movies with a resolution of more than 16MP. More on storage will be covered later.

## Part 1: What is Google Photos?

Google Photos is a platform for uploading, sharing, and storing digital photos. A year after its debut, it's already a global phenomenon. And Google Photographs uses the term "the cloud" to refer to the online storage of your photos and videos.

If you had to do this in the past, you would have had to connect your phone or camera to a computer to upload your photographs and movies. You may have then backed up your PC to an external hard drive. But now, with Google Photos, the process is effortless and does not require a USB connection.

In addition to the benefits listed above, keeping your photographs and movies in the cloud has the following aspects:

* It has many options for organizing, using, sharing, and managing your photographs and videos.
* It's compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
* Anyone can use Google Photos, regardless of their level of computer literacy. It's easy to figure out where you are and how to go about.
* The days of running out of space on your phone are long gone. You'll be able to free up some space on your phone once you've uploaded your pictures and movies.
* As long as you have an internet connection, you may view your photographs and videos from any device (phone, tablet, computer).
* To share an album of images or videos with a friend or family member is easy.
* Whenever you're connected to Wi-Fi, you may schedule automatic backups to take place.
* Storage space is provided at no cost to you. If you want your images to be preserved at their original resolution, you can pay, but you'll probably be happy with the free version's typical excellent quality. Compression is applied to images and movies with a resolution of more than 16MP. More on storage will be covered later.

## Part 2: How to Get Started with Google Photos?

After you’ve installed the app on your smartphone, it’s time to get started with exploring the interface and the various editing options it contains.

**Step** **1**: Launch the app and **Sign In To Your Google Account.** There is a good chance that you already have a Google account (such as Gmail). If you haven't already, it's fast and simple to join up.

**Step** **2**: Once you've logged in, all you have to do is **follow the on-screen instructions** to begin uploading your photographs and videos.

**Note**: If you have many photographs and videos, this may take some time. If you don't want to waste your mobile data, make sure you're connected to the internet through Wi-Fi.

**_Photos, Search, Sharing_**, and **_Library_** are the three primary tabs at the bottom of the Google Photos program. If you're using an iPhone/iPad or an Android device, you'll notice the app has a slightly different design. Let's look into this in more depth:

**1\. The Photos Tab**

**Photos** is the first tab on the left-hand side of the screen. Memories from the past and the most current images may be found here.

![google photos photos interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-photos-interface.jpg)

**2\. The Search Tab**

The **Search** tab appears next. You may use this search to find images of people, places, items on a map, or in a category. You may also see your own animations, collages, and movies in the gallery.

![google photos search interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-search-interface.jpg)

**4\. The Library Tab**

The **Library** tab is the third one on the left-hand side. Your **Albums**, **Favorites** and **Archive** are all here, as well as your Trash.

The **Utilities** menu includes tools for animating, collaging, and creating movies. By tapping on a picture, you may see the photo in its entirety. You may also access the editing and sharing options for a picture in this manner.

## Part 3: Google Photos Video Editing Features

We're introducing some of the editing tools already accessible on Pixel to Google Photos Video Editor users as part of their subscription starting today.

These machine learning effects modify your photos: with **_Portrait Blur_**, you can blur the backdrop post-snap, and with **_Portrait Light_**, you can increase the lighting on faces in portraits.

Both capabilities would work for recent and past photographs, even if the original image was not captured in portrait mode.

**_Blur_** and **_Color Pop_** is still available for photographs with depth information (such as those taken in portrait mode), and anybody with Google Photos may use them for free.

According to today's upgrade, Google Photo Video Editor users may now apply similar effects to even more images of people, even those that lack depth information, such as vintage film scans or professional shots.

Members of Google Photos Video Editor will also access new machine **_learning-powered effects._** Consider them super filters that can make sophisticated adjustments with a single press.

You may use the **_Dynamic_** suggestion to boost **Brightness** and **Contrast** throughout the picture where it's required, resulting in a more dramatic, balanced picture.

With **Sky** recommendations, you can make your golden hour photographs stand out by enhancing and altering the color and contrast in the sky using one of many **Themes** inspired by magnificent sunrises and sunsets.

Besides, other editing features such as **_Adjust, Trim, Cut, Slider, Filters, Color Focus, Skin Tone, Focus, HDR, Portrait Light_**, etc. are some of the basic editing features you get in Google Video Editor Online.
