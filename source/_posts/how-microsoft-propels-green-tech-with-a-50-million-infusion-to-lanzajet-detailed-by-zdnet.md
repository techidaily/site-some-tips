## How Microsoft Propels Green Tech with a $50 Million Infusion to LanzaJet, Detailed by ZDNET

[Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund has invested $50 million in LanzaJet](https://www.lanzajet.com/lanzajet-secures-industry-leading-innovative-financing-with-microsoft-climate-innovation-fund-to-construct-the-worlds-first-commercial-alcohol-to-jet-sustainable-fuel-plant/), a sustainable fuels company. The money will go toward the construction of the Freedom Pines Fuels Plant in Soperton, Ga., which LanzaJet says is the world's first alcohol-to-jet sustainable fuel production plant.

Microsoft is interested in sustainable fuels as a way to make its cloud datacenters less dependent on diesel fuel. LanzaJet says it will bring lower-cost sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel to the global market. LanzaJet says its plant will use waste-based ethanol feedstock as the source for its converted fuel.

Microsoft officials have said the company is committed to being [carbon-negative by 2030](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-ambitious-plan-to-remove-its-entire-carbon-footprint/) and removing from the environment all the carbon it has emitted to date by 2050\. 

Microsoft currently is on track to [build between 50 and 100 new data centers every year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-were-on-pace-to-build-50-to-100-new-datacenters-each-year/). It is working to reduce concrete-and steel-embodied carbon in its building materials by 30% to 60%. It is working to invest in new sustainable materials for building foundations, structures, and enclosures. It is researching how low-carbon materials like earthen slabs, algae-grown bricks/panels, mushroom structural tubes, and agricultural waste panels can help reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, the company has signed power-purchase agreements for renewable energy. 

In 2020, Microsoft officials said they were testing [hydrogen fuel cells as a potential replacement for diesel fuel](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-testing-the-use-of-hydrogen-fuel-cells-in-lieu-of-diesel-for-its-azure-datacenter-servers/)in its data centers.
