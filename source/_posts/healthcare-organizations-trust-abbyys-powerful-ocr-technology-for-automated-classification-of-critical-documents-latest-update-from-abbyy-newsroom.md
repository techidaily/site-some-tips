#### _Partnership to provide powerful integrated advance capture solutions available through resellers_ 

  
ABBYY Europe, a leading global provider of technologies and solutions to action information, has announced that [Nobly](https://www.nobly.dk/ "Nobly Website"), the Danish healthcare software vendor (ISV) has extended the capabilities of NoblyDoc, its electronic medical record (EMR) system, by integrating ABBYY’s automatic document classification component.

The new functionality will be used primarily for patient document archival in healthcare and hospital environments to reduce the time healthcare professionals spend manually classifying and sorting these documents. The highly accurate automated classification process is based on a combination of image criteria, OCR and linguistic technologies.

“_Working extensively within the Danish healthcare industry, we’re seeing an increasing demand for automation of document processing, with anyone from surgeons to administrative workers handling hundreds of document types a day. In order to automate the processing of these crucial documents quickly and accurately, we decided to integrate the [ABBYY FineReader Engine](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) into NoblyDoc. This enables highly accurate automated text extraction and document classification. The result is a smooth and consistent process that eliminates time wasted on sorting and manually inputting information_”, said Simon Guldager, CEO of Nobly.

To implement automated classification in the software, individual document types need to be mapped first. Nobly is expecting to capture over 450 document types such as case notes, prescriptions and files relating to cardiography and anaesthesia. A custom-designed interface allows users of NoblyDoc to easily add new document types. This in turn supports workflow automation and reduces the time needed for manual processing, which can be used instead for direct patient care.

“_ABBYY enables healthcare organisations to optimise document-driven processes by capturing information, automatically classifying and routing it and extracting patient data to health information management systems. By automating this process, healthcare providers can ensure the information is available for better patient care or more efficient administration with minimal labour cost_”, said Sven Diedrich, Director Business Unit Technology Licensing at ABBYY.
