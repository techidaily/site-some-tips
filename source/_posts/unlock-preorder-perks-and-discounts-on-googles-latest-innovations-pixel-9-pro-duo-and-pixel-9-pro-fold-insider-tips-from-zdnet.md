The tech giant released four new smartphones to the market: The [Pixel 9](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-9041660-15878864-1723532409000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [Pixel 9 Pro](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15880958-1723561639000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [Pixel 9 Pro XL](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9041660-15880958-1723561639000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and the [Pixel 9 Pro Fold](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-9041660-15878894-1723532400000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). All four models run on Google's own Tensor G4 chip, have a 24-hour+ battery life, support emergency SOS with crisis alerts, and receive seven years of software and security updates. Preorders for all these Pixel 9 phone models kicked off on Aug. 13.
