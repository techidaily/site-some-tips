## Top 10 Tips to Make Your Podcast Teasers Stand Out

Podcasts are a rising trend nowadays for streamers. The size of the [global podcasting market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/podcast-market) was estimated at USD 11.46 billion in 2020, and it is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 31.1 percent from 2021 to 2028\. However, a fantastic podcast must also have an exciting trailer. It is impossible to neglect the importance of a **podcast trailer** with a **narrator's voice** as it helps creators to draw the viewer's attention. So, in today's blog, we will discuss **how to make a podcast trailer** with its importance in boosting your online presence. So, let's start!

## Part 1\. Why is a trailer important for your podcast?

To know more about the importance of the Podcast trailer, we have to look into the following things:

### What is a podcast trailer?

A podcast trailer is a teaser that introduces your audio or video podcast to the listeners. It can consist of some key features of your podcast with voice. Before they even start listening, it helps listeners get a sense of your podcast.

### Why is it necessary?

A podcast trailer is fundamental in attracting the audience to watch the full podcast. It can help you highlight your podcast's key points and why it stands the best. A fantastic podcast trailer can surely help you in boosting your audience range. It also helps to publish your podcast on any big platform like Apple. You may use the trailer as a starter before the first official episode.

## Part 2\. How to make a good podcast trailer? 5 Tips for it

Now let's look into how you can make a good podcast trailer. You should keep these vital points in mind while making a podcast trailer.

### 1\. Asking Questions at the start

It would be best to start the podcast trailer by asking some questions. This is an excellent choice to build up the audience's interest in your podcast.

### 2\. A clear introduction

A good podcast trailer should introduce you and your podcast with its exciting points and releasing date. Keep it short because viewers might lose attention if you make it lengthy.

### 3\. Engaging background music

It's one of the essential points to make your podcast trailer more amazing. It would help if you had to add some significant sound effects and music to your podcast trailer. This can help in making it more attractive to the audience.

### 4\. Attractive voice

It would be more awesome if you made a podcast trailer with a narrator's voice. You can narrate the central theme or idea of the podcast.

### 5\. Make it interesting for each episode

Each podcast has a unique theme, so it's best to have each one its trailer. But the thing to remember here is that don't use the same intro or lines every time. You have to be unique in every podcast trailer episode. Otherwise, the audience will lose interest in your trailers.

## Part 3\. How to make your podcast trailer?

To enhance your podcast trailer, you can use the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let's look at how it can help make your podcast trailer fantastic.
