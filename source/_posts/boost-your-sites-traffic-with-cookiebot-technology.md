The most important thing for an excellent selfie is your smartphone and its camera. On top of that, there are plenty of accessories and devices that help in taking excellent photos. Let’s talk about them in detail.

**Camera phones**

The key element of a successful selfie is a high-quality camera or a camera phone. Here are the best camera phones of 2017–2018: [Google Pixel 2](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5F2?hl=en-US), [Huawei P20 Pro](https://www.huawei.com/en/press-events/news/2018/3/HUAWEI-P20-P20-Pro), [Samsung S9](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fglobal%2Fgalaxy%2Fgalaxy-s9%2F), [Sony Xperia Z5](https://support.sonymobile.com/global-en/xperiaz5/userguide/#gref) and [iPhone X](https://www.apple.com/uk/). In the [previous](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)Mobile Monday, we addressed the primary functions of built-in cameras in [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/HT207260) and [Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fru%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s8%2Fcamera%2F). We suggest using a timer that will make group selfies and videos a success and a few photo enhancement modes.

**Monopod or selfie stick**

A selfie stick boom is still underway despite risks or bans for using these accessories in some places. There is a great assortment of monopods available on the market: standard, with a remote control, telescopic or even a transformer monopod that acts both as a selfie stick and a tripod.

But have you ever heard of [Flexy Paw](https://www.pawchamps.com/)? This phone accessory allows you to take selfies of your beloved pets. We all know how hard it is to make your dog sit still and look at one spot. That’s where Flexy Paw comes in. [Flexy Paw](https://www.pawchamps.com/) is a tiny phone accessory with a small pin that holds a treat for your pet and is attached to your smartphone. Your pet will look directly into the camera and the photo will come out perfect.

![gadget for selfies flexy paw](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26364/flexy-paw.jpg)

[GripSnap](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/143547447/gripsnap-the-coolest-multi-use-monopod-with-a-magn) is a monopod with a magnetic holder that can be attached to a metal surface such as a light pole or a fence when you have no place to place your phone.

![gadget for selfies grip snap](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26365/grip-snap.jpg)

**Selfie drones**

[Pitta](https://www.pitta.co/) is an unusual device for taking selfies and recording videos. Its developers now raise money on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1627662609/pitta-transformative-autonomous-4k-selfie-drone/updates). This is a ball-shaped gadget that can perform functions of an action camera, drone or a home video surveillance system.

![gadget for selfies selfie drone](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26366/selfie-drone.jpg)

Pittа is controlled from your smartphone on iOS or Android and all the recorded videos are stored on your device. This innovative gadget is trained to automatically take off and land and its battery is capable of keeping it aloft for 15 minutes.

Another exciting device that will draw your attention is [Nixie](http://flynixie.com/). It is a small bracelet with a camera that can transform into a quadcopter. The drone is controlled by means of gestures and can [take off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfzqUsGMHE0), take a picture, and get back on your hand automatically.

![gadget for selfies nixie selfie bracelet](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26367/nixie-selfie-bracelet.jpg)

**Portable photo booth**

[Hypno Eye](https://hypno.cam/) is a ball made of polymeric material with the camera inside. It has a luminous ring around the camera that is used as a flash, it attracts attention and shows where to look to get a perfect shot.

![gadget for selfie hypno eye](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26368/hypno-eye.jpg)

This device can upload recorded videos to the internet by connecting via Wi-Fi or cellular networks. It also adds animation to make your videos truly one-of-a-kind.

![hypno eye animation effect](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26369/hypno-eye-animation-video-1024x429.jpg)

**Photo cameras**

Instant photo cameras are really popular among teenagers and professional Instagrammers. Take [Instax](http://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/instax/index.html), for example. It lets you take a photo and print it… instantly! If you opt for Instax, try scrapbooking sets that enable you to design and make your own photo albums.

![gadget for selfies instant photo instax](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26370/instax-1024x768.jpg)

[Prynt](https://www.prynt.co/#/?%5Fk=p122lz#/#/) is a one-of-a-kind smartphone case that is also a printer. Want to print a photo directly from your smartphone? What can be easier! Just put this case on, pair it with your phone, and voila! You get magical pictures just like in the Harry Potter movies. Select a photo for your camera to send it to a cloud and apply animation. Then print a photo and point your camera to it. It will come to life!

![gadget for selfies prynt instant photo](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26371/prynt-1024x576.jpg)

The [Qlippie](https://www.qlippieworld.com/) portable wide-angle camera is so small that you can hide it in your pocket. With a special clip, this device can be attached to virtually any place. If needed, you can additionally purchase a monopod and cute stickers to freshen up camera’s design.

![gadget for selfies qlippie with different covers](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26372/qlippie.jpg)

[DxO ONE](https://www.dxo.com/us/dxo-one) would be a general digital camera if it didn’t have a lightening plug on the side panel. To use this device, simply install [its app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dxo-one-professional-quality/id981525548?mt=8) and start taking pictures. DxO ONE can take photos in the RAW format that saves a negative to the memory card and a JPEG file to your Gallery. You can easily rotate it to take selfies as well. DxO ONE can be connected only to [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dxo-one-professional-quality/id981525548?mt=8).

![gadget for selfies through lightning for iPhone dxo one](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26373/dxo-one.jpg)

**Camera lenses**

To expand capabilities of your camera even further, attach additional lenses. One of the most widely used lens is [Fish Eye](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Universal-Camera-Microfiber-Carrying-Packaging/dp/B00CSJ50HY) that also comes with a wide angle and macro lenses.

![gadgets for selfies different lenses](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26374/fish-eye.jpg)

You can also buy an even more convenient lens with tripods, just like on the photo below.

![gadget for selfies lens with tripods](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26375/lens-with-tripods.jpg)

Here’s a nice waterproof case for [underwater photo-shooting](http://www.dx.com/p/ultra-clear-170-wide-angle-lens-extreme-sports-waterproof-case-for-iphone-6-6s-transparent-415565?utm%5Frid=37321690&utm%5Fsource=admitad&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&admitad%5Fuid=b7fbc8ce31fa85f2108112d1ebaba618?subid=manual&subid1=gagadget.com&subid2=referral&subid3=waterproof-case&subid4=post21163#.VuHQa6GDumI). Take it on vacation and record unbeatable videos above and under the water surface!

**Some really awkward devices…**

## **First-Hand Experience: Advice From a Colleague**

_By Sergey Kharchenko, iOS developer_

![sergey](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26383/sergey-1024x768.jpg)

When time for vacation comes we want to spend it somewhere near the beach, sun, and water. Yet, even if you have time and money at your disposal, you may lack someone who will accompany you in your marvelous trip. You start reaching out to your friends but most of the time they have other plans. In this case you have two options: either find someone using special online services or go alone.

I personally would go for the second option and here is why:

1. You can stick to your own plans and do not have to conflict with other people.
2. It follows from the first point that you have absolute freedom and can alter your plan at any time. It’s nice to have a plan but its even better to be unexpected.
3. If you are sociable enough, you can try to get acquainted with other people. And who knows, maybe they will be the ones to accompany you next time!
4. The most important thing on a trip is a challenge. Ask yourself: what can I accomplish? Can I overcome myself and grow into a better person? Unforgettable emotions make us better and stronger!

![beach](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26384/beach-1024x768.jpg)

But this way of traveling also comes with a set of disadvantages:

1. Traveling by yourself is often more expensive.
2. If you are not a sociable person it will be hard to find new friends. Now revise item four from the previous list.

You may find your own pros and cons but remember—travelling is an advantage by itself!

![mountains](https://static1.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/26385/mountains-1024x768.jpg)

You’ve weighed all pros and cons and decided to take a chance and travel by yourself. Are you still afraid and have no clue how to overcome fear? Well, just like in many other cases you have two options: jump in feet first or go slowly.

I believe that making your trips more and more complex is a better way to ease into traveling alone. First, I took a package tour, then planned everything myself. From what I see, devising your own travel plan is much better. It allows you to visit places that are left virtually unavailable for package tour travelers. Even though it might cost a pretty penny, it is still worth it!

Thinking of traveling alone, with your partner or with a group? It is always up to you, but in life there’s always a place for something new, right? Why not try all of these options? Go for it! Travelling will give you strength for new achievements and will help you discover something exciting!

That’s all for now, see you next Monday!
