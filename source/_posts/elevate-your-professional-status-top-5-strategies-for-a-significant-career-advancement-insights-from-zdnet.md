## CompTIA A+ certification

Every organization needs information technology security and support. As ZDNet's Charlie Osborne [recently noted](https://www.zdnet.com/education/computers-tech/best-cybersecurity-certification/), it seems that not a week goes by without news of a digital data breach. If you're new to the tech industry or a career switcher who is interested in an entry-level help desk, system support, or systems administrator position, the [CompTIA A+ certification](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a#overview) may benefit you. This certification demonstrates your proficiency and knowledge of these key IT skills:

* Identify and connect hardware components that can support a remote workforce
* Spot security vulnerabilities for network-connected devices

## Essential tech skills include soft skills, too

Education, experience, and job-related skills matter to hiring managers. But emotional intelligence, empathy, ethics, integrity, time management, communication, and teamwork matter too. 

All of those attributes fall into the soft, or people, skills category. And they may help secure your next job opportunity. As [job search site](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/job-search-sites-for-tech/) [Indeed puts it](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/why-are-soft-skills-important), soft skills allow you to maximize the use of your hard skills. Check out these guides on soft skills and tech industry myths:

* [5 soft skills for computer science careers](https://www.zdnet.com/education/computers-tech/soft-skills-for-computer-science-careers/)

* [Common misconceptions about working in tech](https://www.zdnet.com/education/computers-tech/common-misconceptions-working-in-tech/)

## Key steps to level up your career

No matter how you approach shaping your career trajectory, making a few key decisions and moves may position you to step into your desired role. Once you've strengthened your hard skills and polished your soft skills, it's time to take action.

### Prepare for an interview

Whether you're an internal job candidate or applying for a position with another company, experts say that you should prepare for your interview. Researching the company, the position, and even the interviewer's background can also help you decide if the position matches your skills and career interests. 

Check out this ZDNet guide if you want some interview prep insight: [41 impressive questions to ask in a job interview](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/questions-to-ask-in-an-interview/).

### Learn to negotiate your salary

Sixty-three percent of workers who voluntarily left their jobs in 2021 said [low pay was the reason](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/03/09/majority-of-workers-who-quit-a-job-in-2021-cite-low-pay-no-opportunities-for-advancement-feeling-disrespected/).

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the median annual salary for computer and IT occupations was [$97,430 in May 2021](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm). Negotiating your salary should be part of everyone's job upgrade process, whether you're staying with your current company or looking to join a new one.

### Write a professional resignation letter

According to a 2020 [Gallup poll](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx), [21% of millennials](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx) reported changing jobs in the last year. That's more than three times the number of job-changers who weren't born between 1980 and 1996\. And in a [2021 report](https://www.bls.gov/nls/questions-and-answers.htm), the BLS said people born between 1957 and 1964 — younger baby boomers — said they held about 12 jobs between ages 18 and 54\. 

Nearly everyone changes jobs or careers throughout their lifetime. That means you'll need to write a few resignation letters. 

If you need some guidance, check out this guide: [Do's and don'ts for writing a resignation letter](https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/how-to-write-a-resignation-letter/). It may help you avoid burning bridges or going viral for the wrong reasons.
