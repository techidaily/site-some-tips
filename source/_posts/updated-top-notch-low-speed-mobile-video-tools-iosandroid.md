## Top-Notch Low-Speed Mobile Video Tools iOS/Android

The development of technology has made it possible to achieve a great many things and capturing a video in slow motion with fine details is one of them.

Besides adding slow motion effects in post-production, you can now use your iPhone and Android phones along with some camera apps to record a slow motion video.

While you will stumble across a multitude of camera apps that would allow you to capture "slo-mos," not every one of them would offer HD resolution and advanced editing features with them. So, we decided to review some of the best **Slow Motion Camera App** for taking slo-mo videos for you on iPhone and Android phone. Enjoy!

## Best Slow Motion Camera Apps for iPhone and Android Phones

We've put together a list of some of the most incredible slow-motion video applications for Android and iPhone, as well as their built-in cameras, so that our customers may get the best slow-motion films possible. So, go ahead and make your selection.

### 1\. iPhone Camera App

**Supported** **OS**: iOS

Photographs, movies, time-lapse films, and slow-motion recordings may all be captured in high resolution with this program. Whatâ€™s more, the [Portrait mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to blur the backdrop of your portrait shots to create a more professional-looking image. Additionally, the Portrait Lighting tool allows you to create studio lighting effects.

![capture slo mo iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-slo-mo-iphone.jpg)

Apart from these, you get to make slow-motion videos using the iPhone built-in camera. All you have to do is click on the Slo-Mo option on the camera display, choose the best frame rate for your video on the upper right corner between 120FPS and 240 FPS, choose the zoom level from 0.5x to 2x, and guess what?

![samsung slo mo camera captuer options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/samsung-slo-mo-camera-captuer-options.jpg)

### 3\. FiLMiC Pro

**Supported OS**: Android and iOS

Using some of the top camera apps for Android isn't ideal for videography since they aren't as good as they could be for still photography. This is where FiLMiC Pro distinguishes itself from the competition since this software was created specifically with videographers in mind.

As our smartphones become more and more capable of replacing classic DSLR cameras, we will want applications that can use those camera sensors' capabilities.

FiLMiC Pro has also been utilized to produce professional music videos, and it gives you access to all of the capabilities you'll need.

![filmic pro slo mo capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmic-pro-slo-mo-capture-mode.jpg)

Consider the following scenario: you'd want to film footage in slow motion. FiLMiC can assist you in determining your options, such as setting the frame rate, selecting speed, etc.

Selectable framerates are shown at the top of the screen (24, 30, 60 etc). In order to record and replay motion with synced sound, just tap one of these buttons.

With 24fps playback and 2x slower than real-time film, you'll get 48fps: 24fps times 2 = 48 FPS. Slow motion may be achieved by multiplying 30 frames per second by four, or by utilizing a playback framerate of 30 frames per second. In addition, there are frame overlays to ensure that the emphasis of your video is indeed in focus while it is being played.

**Main Features**

* Dual arc sliders for adjustable focus and exposure adjustment.

You have the option of selecting a video speed between 0 and 1 in the range of 0 and 1\. Make use of a value that is less than one for slow-motion video recordings.
