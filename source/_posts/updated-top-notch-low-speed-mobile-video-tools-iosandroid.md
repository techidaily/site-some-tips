### 3\. FiLMiC Pro

**Supported OS**: Android and iOS

Using some of the top camera apps for Android isn't ideal for videography since they aren't as good as they could be for still photography. This is where FiLMiC Pro distinguishes itself from the competition since this software was created specifically with videographers in mind.

As our smartphones become more and more capable of replacing classic DSLR cameras, we will want applications that can use those camera sensors' capabilities.

FiLMiC Pro has also been utilized to produce professional music videos, and it gives you access to all of the capabilities you'll need.

With 24fps playback and 2x slower than real-time film, you'll get 48fps: 24fps times 2 = 48 FPS. Slow motion may be achieved by multiplying 30 frames per second by four, or by utilizing a playback framerate of 30 frames per second. In addition, there are frame overlays to ensure that the emphasis of your video is indeed in focus while it is being played.
