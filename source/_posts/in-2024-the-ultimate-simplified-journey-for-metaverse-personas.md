Metaverse is currently similar to the phrase Internet in the early 1970s. Back in the days defining the internet was practically impossible, but people had an idea of what it would bring. However, Metaverse goes hand in hand with the avatar Metaverse.

As the name Meta suggests, Metaverse refers to a digital reality whose main objective is to blend in virtual reality, augmented reality, social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, and online gaming. Of course, we currently have platforms that feature avatars and virtual identities, but they include one flaw: all these features work on the same platform. This individuality syndrome is what Metaverse wishes to solve.

## Part 1: What is an Avatar?

Generally, an avatar refers to an icon or figure representing a person in a video game, social media platform, etc. In other words, a representation of you on the internet. When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why? Because it is what you use to identify yourself in the digital world.

Think of it in the sense of how you go about opening a social media account. Typically, you will upload your photo as a visual representation of yourself on the platform. The same case happens when dealing with Metaverse; you need an avatar. However, in this case, you don't need your real photo since you settle for a figure where you dress it and design it as per your taste and preference.
