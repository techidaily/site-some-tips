## Revolutionary Milestone by T-Mobile: Ultimate Speed Triumphs as New Record for Sub-6 5G Uploads Established

A new technology called "UL Tx switching" may provide a massive leap in 5G upload speeds. Tests of UL Tx switching, which were conducted by T-Mobile, resulted in 345 Mbps uplink speeds on the Sub-6 5G band. The previous record was just 275 Mbps.

 As you may know, 5G networking relies on a mix of [mmWave, low-band, and mid-band](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-flip-to-fun-converting-youtube-videos-to-playful-download-free-gifs-for-2024/) spectrums. Most of your 5G networking occurs on the mid-band (Sub-6) spectrum, which offers a decent mix of speed and reliability. Very few people have access to super-speedy mmWave 5G, as it has a fairly short range and is prone to interference.

 The new UL Tx switching technology is an upgrade for existing Sub-6 5G networks. It artificially creates more uplink bandwidth by flipping a user through different combinations of Sub-6 frequencies. UL Tx switching also utilizes SU-MIMO (single user multiple input, multiple output), which provides multiple simultaneous upload streams for mobile devices.

 T-Mobile paired up with Qualcomm and Nokia to test the capabilities of UL Tx switching. These tests, which were conducted in North America, relied on Qualcomm's AI-powered Snapdragon Modem-RF system and Nokia AirScale networking hardware. As it turns out, UL Tx switching can provide a 25% boost in Sub-6 5G upload speeds. T-Mobile reached 345 Mbps upload speeds, shattering the [275 Mbps record](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/devices/new-samsung-galaxy-s24-series) it set in January 2024.

 Simultaneous tests were conducted in Australia by [Qualcomm, Telstra, and Ericsson](http://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/7/2024/telstra-together-with-ericsson-and-qualcomm-inc.-announce-world-first-340-mbps-uplink-speed-over-5g-standalone-using-sub-6-ghz-frequencies-in-a-live-commercial-network#:~:text=live%20commercial%20network-,Telstra%2C%20together%20with%20Ericsson%20and%20Qualcomm%20Inc.%20announce%20world%2D,in%20a%20live%20commercial%20network). The Australian tests utilized a consumer-grade NetGear Nighthawk M6 Pro mobile router, which is far more accessible than Nokia AirScale hardware. The Nighthawk M6 Pro managed to reach uplink speeds of 340 Mbpsâ€”a few megabits shy of the North American results, but a great achievement nonetheless.

 Note that UL Tx switching does not improve download speeds. Still, a boost in Sub-6 5G uplink speeds may be hugely beneficial when making video calls, uploading large files, playing online games, and performing other everyday tasks. This is particularly true in homes that use a 5G modem instead of a traditional broadband modem.

 Unfortunately, we don't know when UL Tx switching will be deployed. The real-world benefit of UL Tx switching is also unknown, especially in regard to old or inexpensive 5G modems.
